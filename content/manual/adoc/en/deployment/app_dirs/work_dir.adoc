[[work_dir]]
==== Work Directory

The application uses the work directory to store some persistent data and configuration.

For example, the <<file_storage,file storage>> mechanism by default uses the `filestorage` subdirectory of the work directory. Besides, the Middleware block writes generated <<persistence.xml,persistence.xml>> and `orm.xml` files into the work directory on startup.

Work directory location is determined by the <<cuba.dataDir,cuba.dataDir>> application property. By default, the work directory is located inside the <<app_home,application home>>.
