[[log_dir]]
==== Log Directory

Log directory is a directory where the application creates log files. The location and content of log files is defined by the configuration of the *Logback* framework provided in the `logback.xml` file. See <<logging>> for more details.

Location of log files is usually specified relative to <<app_home,application home>> directory, for example:

[source,xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/log_dir_1.xml[]
----

You should also specify the same directory as defined by `logback.xml` in the <<cuba.logDir,cuba.logDir>> application property. It will allow system administrators to view and load log files in the *Administration > Server Log* screen.
