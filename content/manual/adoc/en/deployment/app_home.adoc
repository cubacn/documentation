[[app_home]]
=== Application Home

Application home is a file system directory where the CUBA application stores temporary files and where you can place <<app_properties_files,local.app.properties>> and <<logging,logback.xml>> configuration files. Most of the <<app_dirs,application directories>> described below are located in the application home. <<file_storage,File storage>> also uses a subdirectory in the application home by default.

The framework gets the application home path from the `app.home` Java system property. Normally, this property should be set using the `-D` command line argument when starting Java.

If the `app.home` system property is not provided from the command line, it is set automatically according to the following rules:

. If the application is started as UberJAR, the current working directory becomes application home.

. If `catalina.base` system property is set (i.e. the application is working under Tomcat), the application home is set to `${catalina.base}/work/app_home`.

. Otherwise, app home is set to the `.app_home` subdirectory of the user home directory.

[WARNING]
====
Options 2 and 3 have the following drawback: the Logback initialization procedure comes into play before the `app.home` property is set, so references like `${app.home}` in `logback.xml` won't work and location of log files (if it is defined using such link) will be undetermined. Also, you won't be able to override logging properties simply by adding `logback.xml` to the application home because it won't be found by the initialization procedure.
====

When using <<fast_deployment>> at development stage, the application home is set to the `deploy/app_home` directory of your project since CUBA 7.2. If your project is based on an older version of the platform, the application directories are located inside Tomcat's `conf` and `work` subdirectories.

When running <<uberjar_deployment,UberJAR>>, specify `-D` command line argument or just assume the current directory as application home, for example:

----
java -Dapp.home=/opt/app_home -jar app.jar
----

When using WAR deployment, set `app.home` using `-D` command line argument in an appropriate startup script or by another recommended for the application server way. For example, in Tomcat, create `bin/setenv.sh` script with the following content:

----
CATALINA_OPTS="-Dapp.home=\"$CATALINA_BASE/work/app_home\" -Xmx512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
----

If you are using <<tomcat_war_deployment,deployment to Tomcat Windows Service>>, place each property on a separate line in the Tomcat service settings window.
