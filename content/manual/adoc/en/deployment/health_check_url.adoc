[[health_check_url]]
=== Health Check URL

Every application block deployed as a web application provides a health check URL. An HTTP GET request for this URL returns `ok` if the block is ready to work.

The URL paths for different blocks are listed below:

* Middleware: `/remoting/health`
* Web Client: `/dispatch/health`
* Web Portal: `/rest/health` (requires {rest_man_url}[REST API add-on])

So for an application named `app` and deployed at `++localhost:8080++` the URLs will be:

* `\http://localhost:8080/app-core/remoting/health`
* `\http://localhost:8080/app/dispatch/health`
* `\http://localhost:8080/app-portal/rest/health`

You can replace `ok` in response with any text using the <<cuba.healthCheckResponse,cuba.healthCheckResponse>> application property.

The health check controllers also send an application <<events,event>> of type `HealthCheckEvent`. Therefore you can add your own logic of checking the application health. In the https://github.com/cuba-platform/sample-base/blob/master/modules/web/src/com/haulmont/addon/samplebase/web/HealthCheckListener.java[example on GitHub], a bean of the web tier listens to the health check events and invokes a middleware service, which in turn executes an operation on the database.
