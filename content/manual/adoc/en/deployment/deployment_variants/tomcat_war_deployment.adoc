==== WAR deployment to Tomcat Windows Service

. Use the CUBA project tree > *Project* > *Deployment* > *WAR Settings* dialog in Studio or just manually add the <<build.gradle_buildWar, buildWar>> task to the end of <<build.gradle,build.gradle>>:
+
--
[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/warDeployment_2.groovy[]
----

If the target server parameters differ from what you have on the local Tomcat used for <<fast_deployment,fast deployment>>, provide appropriate application properties. For example, if the target server runs on port 9999 and you build separate WARs, the task definition should be as follows:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/warDeployment_3.groovy[]
----
You can also specify a separate `context.xml` file to setup the connection to the production database or provide that file later on the server:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/deployment/warDeployment_4.groovy[]
----
--
. Run the `buildWar` Gradle task. As a result, `app.war` file (or several files if you build separate WARs) will be generated in the `build/distributions` directory of your project.
+
[source, plain]
----
gradlew buildWar
----
. Create the <<app_home,application home>> directory, e.g. `C:\app_home`.

. Download and install the Tomcat 9 Windows Service Installer from the https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi[Apache Tomcat official site].

. Go to the `bin` directory of the installed server and run `tomcat9w.exe` with the administrative rights in order to set Tomcat service settings:
.. Set *Maximum memory pool* to 1024MB on the *Java* tab.
.. Instruct Tomcat to use UTF-8 encoding by adding `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` to the _Java Options_ field.
.. Specify application home folder by adding the `-Dapp.home=c:/app_home` to the _Java Options_ field.

. If you want to provide production database connection properties with a local file on the server, you can create a file in the `conf\Catalina\localhost` subfolder of the Tomcat server. The name of the file depends on the WAR file name, e.g. `app.xml` for single WAR and `app-core.xml` if separate WAR files are deployed. Copy contents of the `context.xml` to this file.

. With the default configuration all application log messages are appended to the `logs/tomcat9-stdout.log` file. You have two options how to customize logging configuration of the application:

* Create the logback configuration file in the project. Specify path to this file for the `logbackConfigurationFile` parameter of the <<build.gradle_buildWar, buildWar>> task (manually or with the help of Studio *WAR Settings* dialog).
* Create the logging configuration file on the production server.
+
Copy the `logback.xml` file from the development Tomcat (`deploy/tomcat/conf` project sub-folder) to the <<app_home,application home>> directory and edit the `logDir` property in this file:
+
[source, xml]
----
<property name="logDir" value="${app.home}/logs"/>
----
+
Add the following line to the _Java Options_ field in the Tomcat 9 Windows Service settings window to specify path to the logging configuration file:
+
[source,plain]
----
-Dlogback.configurationFile=C:/app_home/logback.xml
----

. Copy the generated WAR file(s) to the `webapps` directory of the Tomcat server.

. Restart the Tomcat service.

. Open `++http://localhost:8080/app++` in your web browser.
