==== Creating Local Administrators

The hierarchical structure of <<groups,access groups>> combined with the <<constraints,constraints>> inheritance enables creating _local administrators_, by delegating creation and configuration of users and their rights to organization departments.

The local administrators have access to the security subsystem screens; however, they only see the users and groups in their access group and below. Local administrators can create subgroups and users and <<roles,assign>> roles available in the system, however, they will have at least the same constraints as the administrator who created them.

The global administrator in the root access group should create the roles that will be available to the local administrators for assigning to the users. The local administrators should not be able to create and update the roles.

An example access group structure is presented below:

Problem:

* The users under the `*Departments*` group should only see the users of their own group and the groups below.

* Each subgroup â€“ `*Dept 1*`, `*Dept 2*`, etc. should have its own administrator, who can create users and assign them the available roles.

Solution:

* Add the following constraints for the `*Departments*` group:

** For the `sec$Group` entity:
+
[source, plain]
----
{E}.id in (
  select h.group.id from sec$GroupHierarchy h
  where h.group.id = :session$userGroupId or h.parent.id = :session$userGroupId
)
----
+
With this constraint, the users will not be able to see the groups higher than their own.

** For the `sec$User` entity:
+
[source, plain]
----
{E}.group.id in (
  select h.group.id from sec$GroupHierarchy h
  where h.group.id = :session$userGroupId or h.parent.id = :session$userGroupId
)
----
+
With this constraint, the users will not be able to see the users in groups higher than their own.

** For the `sec$Role` entity (a Groovy constraint checked in memory):
+
[source, plain]
----
!['system-full-access', 'Some Role to Hide 1', 'Some Role to Hide 2'].contains({E}.name)
----
+
With this constraint, the users will not be able to view and assign unwanted roles.

* Create the `Department Administrator` role for local administrators:
+
--
** On the *Screens* tab, allow the following screens:
+
`Administration`, `Users`, `Access Groups`, `Roles`, `sec$Group.edit`, `sec$Group.lookup`, `sec$Role.lookup`, `sec$User.changePassword`, `sec$User.copySettings`, `sec$User.edit`, `sec$User.lookup`, `sec$User.newPasswords`, `sec$User.resetPasswords`, `sec$UserSubstitution.edit`.

** On the *Entities* tab, allow all operations for `sec$Group`, `sec$User`, `sec$UserRole` entities and allow the *Read* operation for the `sec$Role` entity (to add permissions for the `sec$UserRole` object, select the *System level* checkbox).

** On the *Attributes* tab, select "*" for `sec$Group`, `sec$User` and `sec$Role` entities.
--

* Create local administrators in their departments as shown on the screenshot above and assign the `Department Administrator` role to them.

As a result, when local administrators log in to the system, they see only their department group and nested groups:

The local administrator can create new users and assign to them existing roles except listed in the constraint.
