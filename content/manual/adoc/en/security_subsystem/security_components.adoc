Below is an overview of these components. 

_Security management screens_ – screens available to system administrator for configuring <<users,user>> access rights.

_Login screen_ − system <<login_screen,login>> window. This window provides user authentication by username and password. The database stores password hashes for security.

The <<userSession,UserSession>> object is created upon login. This is the central security element associated with the currently authenticated user and containing information on data access rights.

The user login process is described in the <<login,>> section.

_Roles_ − user roles. A <<roles,role>> is an object which defines a set of <<permissions,permission>>. A user can have multiple roles.

_Access Groups_ − user access groups. The <<groups,groups>> have a hierarchical structure, with each element defining a set of <<constraints,constraints>>, allowing to control access to individual entity instances (at table row level).
