[[permissions]]
==== Permissions

The _permission_ determines the user's right to any system object or functionality, such as screen, entity operation, etc. The permission can either grant the user the right to the object, or revoke it (in essence, it is actually a _prohibition_).

[TIP]
====
By default, the user has the right to an object, unless explicitly denied by a permission.
====

The permissions are granted by the `sec$Permission` entity instances and contain the following attributes:

* `type` – permission type: determines the object type the permission is imposed on.

* `target` – permission object: determines the specific object the permission is imposed on. The format of the attribute depends on the permission type.

* `value` – permission value. The value range depends on the permission type.

The permission types are described below:

* `PermissionType.SCREEN` – screen permission.
+
The screen identifier should be specified in the `target` attribute; the `value` attribute can be 0 or 1 (the screen is denied or allowed, respectively).
+
The screen permissions are checked when building the system main menu and with each invocation of the `openWindow()`, `openEditor()`, `openLookup()` methods of the <<abstractFrame,Frame>> interfaces.
+
To check the screen permission in the application code, use the `isScreenPermitted()` method of the <<security,Security>> interface.

* `++PermissionType.ENTITY_OP++` – entity operation permission.
+
The entity name should be specified in the `target` attribute, followed by a colon, and then an operation type: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`. For example: `*library_Book:delete*`. The `value` attribute can be 0 or 1 (the operation is denied or allowed, respectively).
+
See the <<data_access_checks>> section for how entity operation permissions are used by different mechanisms of the framework.
+
To check the entity operation permission in the application code, use the `isEntityOpPermitted()` method of the <<security,Security>> interface.

* `++PermissionType.ENTITY_ATTR++` – entity attribute permission.
+
The entity name should be specified in the `target` attribute, followed by a colon, and then an attribute name. For example: `*library_Book:name*`. The `value` attribute can be 0, 1 or 2 (the attribute is hidden, read-only or read-write, respectively).
+
See the <<data_access_checks>> section for how entity attribute permissions are used by different mechanisms of the framework.
+
To check the entity attribute permission in the application code, use the `isEntityAttrPermitted()` method of the <<security,Security>> interface.

* `PermissionType.SPECIFIC` – permission on an arbitrary named functionality. Specific permissions can be used instead of roles for binary permitting/denying some project-specific functionality, as roles are designed for aggregating permissions.
+
The functionality identifier should be specified in the `target` attribute; the `value` attribute can be 0 or 1 (denied or allowed, respectively).
+
Specific permissions for this project are set in the configuration file <<permissions.xml,permissions.xml>>.
+
For example:
+
[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Security security;

private void calculateBalance() {
    if (!security.isSpecificPermitted("myapp.calculateBalance"))
        return;
    ...
}
----

* `PermissionType.UI` – arbitrary screen component permission.
+
The screen identifier should be specified in the `target` attribute, followed by a colon, and then a component path. The format of the component path is described in the next section.

[TIP]
====
To check permissions, instead of directly using methods of the `UserSession` class, it is recommended to use the same methods of <<security,Security>> interface that works with possible entity <<entity_extension,extension>>.
