[[users]]
==== Users

Each system user has a corresponding instance of `sec$User` entity, containing unique login, password hash, reference to access group and list of roles, and other attributes. User management is carried out using the *Administration* > *Users screen*: 

image::security_user_browser.png[align="center"]

In addition to the standard actions to create, update and delete records, the following actions are available:

* *Copy* – quickly creates a new user based on the selected one. The new user will have the same access group and role set. Both can be changed in the new user edit screen.

* *Copy settings* – enables copying user interface settings from one user to several others. The settings include the <<gui_Table_presentations,table presentations>>, the <<gui_SplitPanel,SplitPanel>> separator position, <<gui_Filter,filters>> and <<folders_pane,search folders>>.

* *Change password* – allowing changing password for a selected user.

* *Reset passwords* – enables performing the following actions on selected users:

** If *Generate new passwords* flag is not selected in the *Reset passwords for selected users* dialog, the *Change password at next logon* flag will be assigned to selected users. These users will be asked to change the password on the next successful login.
+
[TIP]
====
In order to be able to change their passwords, the users must have permission to the `sec$User.changePassword` screen. Keep it in mind when configuring <<roles,roles>>, especially if you assign a *Denying* role to all users. The screen can be found under the *Other screens* entry in the role editor.
====

** If *Generate new passwords flag* is selected, new random passwords will be generated for selected users and displayed to the system administrator. The list of passwords can be exported to XLS and sent to related users. Additionally, the *Change password at next logon* flag will be set for each user, ensuring that users change the password on next login.

** If *Send emails with generated passwords* flag is selected in addition to *Generate new passwords*, the automatically generated one-time passwords will be sent to corresponding users directly, and not shown to system administrator. The sending is done asynchronously so it requires a special scheduled task mentioned in section <<email_sending_methods>>.

The template of password reset emails can be modified. Create custom templates in the *core* module, taking https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba/blob/master/modules/core/src/com/haulmont/cuba/security/app/email/reset-password-subject.gsp[reset-password-subject.gsp] and https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba/blob/master/modules/core/src/com/haulmont/cuba/security/app/email/reset-password-body.gsp[reset-password-body.gsp] as an example. In order to localize templates, if needed, create files with locale suffixes, as it is done in the https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba/tree/master/modules/core/src/com/haulmont/cuba/security/app/email[platform].


The templates are based on Groovy `SimpleTemplateEngine` syntax, thus you can use Groovy blocks inside of the template content. For instance:

[source, plain]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/security/reset-password-body.gsp[]
----

Data binding for these templates contains `user`, `password`, and `persistence` variables. You can also use any Spring beans of the middleware if you import `AppBeans` class and get them using `AppBeans.get()` method.

Having overridden the templates, in the `app.properties` of the *core* module specify the following properties:

[source, xml]
----
cuba.security.resetPasswordTemplateBody = <relative path to your file>
cuba.security.resetPasswordTemplateSubject = <relative path to your file>
----

In a production environment, the templates can also be placed in the <<conf_dir,configuration directory>> and the properties can be added to the `local.app.properties` file.

The user edit screen is described below:

image::security_user_editor.png[align="center"]

* *Login* – unique login name (required).

* *Group* – <<groups,access group>>.

* *Last name*, *First name*, *Middle name* – parts of user's full name.

* *Name* – automatically generated user's full name. Based on full name parts above and a rule defined in the <<cuba.user.fullNamePattern,cuba.user.fullNamePattern>> application property. The name can also be changed manually.

* *Position* – job position.

* *Language* – the user interface language that will be set for the user, if the ability to choose a language on login is turned off using the <<cuba.localeSelectVisible,cuba.localeSelectVisible>> application property.

* *Time Zone* – the <<timeZone,time zone>> that will be used for displaying and entering timestamp values.

* *Email* – email address.

* *Active* – if not set, the user is unable to login to the system.

* *Permitted IP Mask* – IP address mask, defining addresses from which the user is allowed to login.
+
The mask is a list of IP addresses, separated by commas. Both the IPv4 and IPv6 address formats are supported. IPv4 address should consist of four numbers separated with periods. IPv6 address represents eight groups of four hexadecimal characters separated with colons. The "*" symbol can be used in place of an address part, to match any value. Only one type of address format (IPv4 or IPv6) can be used in the mask at the same time.
+
Example: `++192.168.*.*++`

* *Roles* – user <<roles,roles>> list.

* *Substituted Users* – <<user_substitution,substituted>> users list.
