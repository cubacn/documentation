==== Access Groups

With access groups, users can be organized into a hierarchical structure and assigned <<constraints,constraints>> and arbitrary <<session_attr,session attributes>>.

A user can be added to a single group only, however they inherit the list of constraints and session attributes from all the groups up the hierarchy.

User access groups can be defined in the application code or at run time using the *Administration > Access Groups* screen. In the former case, create classes extending `AnnotatedAccessGroupDefinition` and add `@AccessGroup` annotations using the `parent` attribute to configure the hierarchy of groups. The classes must be located in the `core` module. For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/security/groups_1.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/security/groups_2.java[]
----

include::groups/constraints.adoc[]

include::groups/session_attr.adoc[]
