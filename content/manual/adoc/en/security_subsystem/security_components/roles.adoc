[[roles]]
==== Roles

A role combines a set of <<permissions,permissions>> that can be granted to users.

The user may have multiple roles, in which case a logical sum (OR) is computed from all of the assigned roles. For example, if a user has roles A and B where role A does not grant a permission to X and role B allows X, then X will be allowed.

A role can grant permissions to individual targets, as well as to the whole categories of targets: screens, entity operations, entity attributes, specific permissions. For example, you can easily give the Read permission to all entities and the View permission to all their attributes.

The screen component permissions are a notable exception to the above rules: they can be defined only for a concrete component, and if no role defines a permission to a component, it is fully available to the user.

A role can be "default" with regards to users, which means that it is assigned to new users automatically. It allows you to grant a certain set of permissions to each new user by default.

[[roles_design_time]]
Defining roles at design time::
+
--
The recommended way to define a role is to create a class extending `AnnotatedRoleDefinition`, override the methods returning permissions for different target types, and add annotations that specify what permissions this role contains. The class must be located in the `core` module. For example, a role granting permissions to work with the `Customer` entity and its browse and edit screens may look as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/security/roles_1.java[]
----

The annotations can be specified multiple times. For example, the following role gives read-only access to all entities and their attributes, allows to modify customer's `grade` and `comments` attributes, allows to create/update order entity and all its attributes:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/security/roles_2.java[]
----

[WARNING]
====
You can create roles at design time only if the <<cuba.security.rolesPolicyVersion,cuba.security.rolesPolicyVersion>> application property is set to 2, which is the default for new projects created with CUBA 7.2 or newer. If you are migrating from an earlier version, see <<legacy_roles>>.

[[roles_run_time]]
Defining roles at run time::
+
--
The framework contains UI that allows you to define roles in the running application, see *Administration > Roles*. Roles created at run time can be modified or removed. Roles defined at design time are read-only.

On the upper part of the role editor screen you can define common role parameters. The bottom part of the screen contains tabs for defining permissions.

* The *Screens* tab configures screen permissions. The tree reflects the structure of the application's main menu. In order to set permissions for a screen not accessible through the main menu (for example, an entity edit screen), find it in the *Other screens* which is the last tree element.
+
*Allow all screens* checkbox enables all screens at once. It is an equivalent of `@ScreenAccess(screenIds = "*")`.

* The *Entities* tab configures entity operation permissions. The *Assigned only* checkbox is selected by default, so that the table contains only the entities that have explicit permissions in this role. Therefore, the table for a new role will be empty. In order to add permissions, uncheck *Assigned only* and click *Apply*. The entity list can be filtered by entering a part of an entity name in the *Entity* field and clicking *Apply*. The *System level* checkbox enables viewing and selecting system entities marked with the `@SystemLevel` annotation, which are not shown by default.
+
Use *Allow all entities* panel to enable operations for all entities. It is an equivalent of `@EntityAccess(entityName = "*", ...)`.

* The *Attributes* tab configures entity attribute permissions. The *Permissions* column in the entity table shows the list of the attributes that have explicit permissions. Entity list can be managed similarly to the list in the *Entities* tab.
+
Use *Allow all attributes* panel to enable viewing or modification of all attributes for all entities. If you want to enable all attributes for a specific entity, select the "++*++" checkbox at the bottom of the *Permissions* panel for this entity. The same can be achieved using the "*" wildcard in the `entityName` and `view/modify` attributes of the `@EntityAttributeAccess` annotation.

* The *Specific* tab configures specific permissions. The <<permissions.xml,permissions.xml>> configuration file defines the names of specific permissions used in the project.
+
*Allow all specific permissions* checkbox is an equivalent of `@SpecificAccess(permissions = "*")`.

* The *UI* tab configures UI screen component permissions. In order to create a permission, select the desired screen in the *Screen* drop-down list, specify the component path in the *Component* field, and click *Add*. Follow the rules described in the <<permissions>> sections when specifying the target component. You can use the *Components tree* button to see the screen components structure: select a component in the tree and click *Copy id to path* in the context menu.

[[security_scope]]
Security scopes::
+
--
_Security scopes_ allow users to have different sets of roles (and hence different permissions) depending on what client technology they are using to access the application. The security scope is specified using the `securityScope` attribute of the `@Role` annotation or using the *Security scope* field of the role editor screen if the role is defined at run time.

The core framework has a single client - <<gui_framework,Generic UI>>, so all roles have the `GENERIC_UI` scope by default. All users logging in to the generic UI of your application will get the set of roles marked with this scope.

The {rest_man_url}[REST API add-on] defines its own `REST` scope, so if you add it to the project, you should configure a separate set of roles for users logging in to the system through the REST API. If you don't do it, the users will not be able to login via REST because they won't have any permissions including the `cuba.restApi.enabled` specific permission.
--

[[system_roles]]
System roles::
+
--
The framework provides two predefined roles for the `GENERIC_UI` scope:

* `system-minimal` role contains the minimal set of permissions to allow users to work with Generic UI. It is defined by the `MinimalRoleDefinition` class. The role grants the `cuba.gui.loginToClient` specific permission, as well as permissions to some system-level entities and screens. The `system-minimal` role has the `default` attribute set, so it is automatically assigned to all new users.

* `system-full-access` role gives all permissions and can be used for creating administrators having all rights to the application. The built-in `admin` user has this role by default.
