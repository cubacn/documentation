===== Creating Datasources

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For new data API available since release 7.0, see <<gui_data>>.
====

Datasource objects can be created both declaratively, using an XML screen descriptor, and programmatically in a controller. Typically, standard implementation of datasources is used, however, you can create your own class that is inherited from a standard one, if necessary.
