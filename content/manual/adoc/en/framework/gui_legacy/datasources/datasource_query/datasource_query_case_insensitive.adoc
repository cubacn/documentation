[[datasource_query_case_insensitive]]
====== Case-Insensitive Search for a Substring

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For new data API available since release 7.0, see <<gui_data>>.
====

It is possible to use a special feature of JPQL queries execution in datasources, described for the <<query,Query>> interface of the *Middleware* level: for easy creation of case-insensitive search condition of any substring, `(?i)` prefix can be used. However, due to the fact that the query value is usually passed implicitly, the following differences take place:

* The `(?i)` prefix should be specified before a parameter name and not inside the value.

* The parameter value will be automatically converted to lowercase.

* If the parameter value does not have `%` characters, they will be added to the beginning and the end.

Below is an example of how to process the following query:

[source, sql]
----
select c from sales$Customer c where c.name like :(?i)component$customerNameField
----

In this case, the parameter value taken from the `customerNameField` component will be converted to lowercase and will be framed with `%` characters, and then an SQL query with a `lower(C.NAME) like ?` condition will be executed in the database.

Please note that with this search, an index created in the DB by the `NAME` field, will not be used.
