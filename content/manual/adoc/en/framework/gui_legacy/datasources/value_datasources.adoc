===== Value Datasources

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For new data API available since release 7.0, see <<gui_data>>.
====

Value datasources enable execution of queries that return scalar values and aggregates. For example, you can load some aggregated statistics for customers:

[source, sql]
----
select o.customer, sum(o.amount) from demo$Order o group by o.customer
----

Value datasources work with entities of a special type named `KeyValueEntity`. This entity can contain an arbitrary number of attributes which are defined at runtime. So in the example above, the `KeyValueEntity` instances will contain two attributes: the first of type `Customer` and the second of type `BigDecimal`.

Value datasource implementations extend other widely used collection datasource classes and implement a specific interface: `ValueDatasource`. Below is a diagram showing the value datasource implementations and their base classes:

The `ValueDatasource` interface declares the following methods:

* `addProperty()` - as the datasource can return entities with any number of attributes, you have to specify what attributes are expected by using this method. It accepts a name of the attribute and its type in the form of <<datatype,Datatype>> or a Java class. In the latter case, the class should be either an entity class or a class supported by one the datatypes.

* `setIdName()` is an optional method which allows you to define one of the attributes as an identifier attribute of the entity. It means that `KeyValueEntity` instances contained in this datasource will have identifiers obtained from the given attribute. Otherwise, `KeyValueEntity` instances get randomly generated UUIDs.

* `getMetaClass()` returns a dynamic implementation of the `MetaClass` interface that represents the current schema of `KeyValueEntity` instances. It is defined by previous calls to `addProperty()`.

Value datasources can be used declaratively in a screen XML descriptor. There are three XML elements corresponding to the implementation classes:

* `valueCollectionDatasource`
* `valueGroupDatasource`
* `valueHierarchicalDatasource`

XML definition of a value datasource must contain the `properties` element that defines the attributes of `KeyValueEntity` instances that will be contained in the datasource (see the `addProperty()` method description above). The order of `property` elements should conform to the order of result set columns returned by the query. For example, in the following definition the `customer` attribute will get its value from `o.customer` column and the `sum` attribute from `sum(o.amount)` column:

[source, xml]

Value datasources are designed only for reading data, because `KeyValueEntity` is not persistent and cannot be saved by standard persistence mechanisms.

You can create value datasources either manually or in Studio in the *Datasources* tab of the *Screen designer* page.

The *Properties* editor allows you to create the datasource attributes of a certain datatype and/or a Java class.
