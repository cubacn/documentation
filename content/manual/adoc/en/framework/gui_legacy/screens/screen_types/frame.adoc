[[frame]]
====== Frame

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For new data API available since release 7.0, see <<screen_controllers>>.
====

Frames are reusable parts of screens. Frames are included in screens using the <<gui_Frame,frame>> XML element.

A frame controller must extend the <<abstractFrame,AbstractFrame>> class.

[TIP]
====
You can create a frame in Studio using the *Blank frame* template.
====

Below are the rules of interaction between a frame and its enclosing screen:

* Frame components can be referenced from a screen using dot: `++frame_id.component_id++`

* List of screen components can be obtained from a frame controller by invoking `++getComponent(component_id)++` method, but only if there is no component with the same name in the frame itself. I.e. frame components mask screen components.

* Screen <<datasources,datasource>> can be obtained from a frame by invoking `++getDsContext().get(ds_id)++` method or <<screen_controller_injection,injection>>, or using `++ds$ds_id++` in <<datasource_query,query>>, but only if the datasource with the same name is not declared in the frame itself (same as for components).

* From a screen, frame datasource can be obtained only by iterating the `getDsContext().getChildren()` collection.

The screen commit causes commit of modified datasources of all frames included in the screen.
