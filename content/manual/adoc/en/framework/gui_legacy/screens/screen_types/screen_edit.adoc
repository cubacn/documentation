[[screen_edit]]
====== Edit Screen

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For new data API available since release 7.0, see <<screen_controllers>>.
====

Edit screen is designed to display and edit entity instances. It initializes the instance being edited and contains <<gui_Action,actions>> for committing changes to the database. Edit screen should be opened by the `openEditor()` method accepting an entity instance as an argument.

By default, the standard <<createAction,CreateAction>> and <<editAction,EditAction>> open a screen, registered in <<screens.xml,screens.xml>> with the `{entity_name}.edit` identifier, for example, `sales$Customer.edit`.

Edit screen controller must be inherited from the <<abstractEditor,AbstractEditor>> class.

[TIP]
====
You can create an edit screen for an entity in Studio using the *Entity editor* template.
====

The `datasource` attribute of a screen's XML should refer to a datasource containing the edited entity instance. The following standard button frames in the XML can be used to display actions that commit or cancel changes:

* `editWindowActions` (file `com/haulmont/cuba/gui/edit-window.actions.xml`) – contains *OK* and *Cancel* buttons

* `extendedEditWindowActions` (file `com/haulmont/cuba/gui/extended-edit-window.actions.xml`) – contains *OK & Close*, *OK* and *Cancel*

The following actions are implicitly initialized in the edit screen:

* `windowCommitAndClose` (corresponds to the `++Window.Editor.WINDOW_COMMIT_AND_CLOSE++` constant) – an action committing changes to the database and closing the screen. The action is initialized if the screen has a visual component with `windowCommitAndClose` identifier. The action is displayed as an *OK & Close* button when the mentioned above standard `extendedEditWindowActions` frame is used.

* `windowCommit` (corresponds to the `++Window.Editor.WINDOW_COMMIT++` constant) – an action which commits changes to the database. In absence of `windowCommitAndClose` action, closes the screen after committing. The action is always displayed as an *OK* button if the screen has the abovementioned standard frames.

* `windowClose` (corresponds to the `++Window.Editor.WINDOW_CLOSE++` constant) – which closes the screen without committing any changes. The action is always initialized. If the screen has the abovementioned standard frames, it is displayed as *Cancel* button.

Thus, if the screen contains an `editWindowActions` frame, the *OK* button commits the changes and closes the screen, and the *Cancel* button – closes the screen without committing the changes. If the screen contains an `extendedEditWindowActions` frame, the *OK* button only commits the changes, *OK & Close* button commits the changes and closes the screen, and the *Cancel* button closes the screen without committing the changes.

Instead of standard frames, the actions can be visualized using arbitrary components, for example, <<gui_LinkButton,LinkButton>>.
