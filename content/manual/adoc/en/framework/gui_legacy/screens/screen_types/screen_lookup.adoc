====== Lookup Screen

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For new data API available since release 7.0, see <<screen_controllers>>.
====

Lookup screens are designed to select and return instances or lists of entities. The standard <<lookupAction,LookupAction>> in visual components like <<gui_PickerField,PickerField>> and <<gui_LookupPickerField,LookupPickerField>> invokes lookup screens to select related entities.

When a lookup screen is invoked by the `openLookup()` method, it contains a panel with the buttons for selection. When a user selects an instance or multiple instances, the lookup screen invokes the handler which was passed to it, thus returning results to the calling code. When being invoked by `openWindow()` method or, for example, from the main menu, the selection panel is not displayed, effectively transforming the lookup screen into a <<screen_simple,simple screen>>.

The controller of a lookup screen should be inherited from the <<abstractLookup,AbstractLookup>> class. The `lookupComponent` attribute of the screen's XML must point to a component (for example <<gui_Table,Table>>), from which the selected entity instance should be taken as a result of the lookup.

[TIP]
====
You can create a lookup screen for an entity in Studio using the *Entity browser* or *Entity combined screen* templates.
====

By default, the <<lookupAction,LookupAction>> uses a lookup screen registered in <<screens.xml,screens.xml>> with the `{entity_name}.lookup` or `{entity_name}.browse` identifier, for example, `sales$Customer.lookup`. So make sure you have one when using components mentioned above. Studio registers browse screens with `{entity_name}.browse` identifiers, so they are automatically used as lookup screens.

[[screen_lookup_customization]]
Customization of the lookup screen look and behavior::
+
--
* To change the lookup panel (*Select* and *Cancel* buttons) for all lookup screens in the project, create a frame and register it with the `lookupWindowActions` identifier. The default frame is in `/com/haulmont/cuba/gui/lookup-window.actions.xml`. Your frame must contain a button linked to the `lookupSelectAction` action (which is added automatically to the screen when it is opened as a lookup).

* To replace the lookup panel in a certain screen, just create a button linked to the `lookupSelectAction` action in the screen. Then the default frame will not be added. For example:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screen_lookup_1.xml[]
----

* To replace the default select action with a custom one, just add your action in the controller:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screen_lookup_2.java[]
----
+
Use `com.haulmont.cuba.gui.components.SelectAction` as a base class for your action and override its methods when needed.
