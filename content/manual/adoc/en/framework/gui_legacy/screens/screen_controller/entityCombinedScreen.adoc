This is a legacy API. For the new API available since v.7.0, see <<screen_controllers>>.
====

`EntityCombinedScreen` is the base class for <<screen_combined,combined screen>> controllers. It is a subclass of <<abstractLookup,AbstractLookup>>.

The `EntityCombinedScreen` class looks up key components such as table, field group and others by hardcoded identifiers. If you name your components differently, override protected methods of the class and return your identifiers to let the controller find your components. See the class JavaDocs for details.
