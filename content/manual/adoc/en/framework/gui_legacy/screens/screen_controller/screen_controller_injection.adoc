====== Controller Dependency Injection

[WARNING]
====
This is a legacy API. For the new API available since v.7.0, see <<screen_controllers>>.
====

Dependency Injection in controllers can be used to acquire references to utilized objects. For this purpose it is required to declare either a field of the corresponding type or a write access method (setter) with an appropriate parameter type and with one of the following annotations:

* `@Inject` – the simplest option, where an object for injection will be found according to the field/method type and the name of the field or attribute corresponding to the method according to JavaBeans rules.

* `@Named("someName")` – explicitly defines the name of the target object.

The following objects can be injected into controllers: 

* This screen's visual components defined in the XML-descriptor. If the attribute type is derived from `Component`, the system will search for a component with the corresponding name within the current screen. 

* Actions defined in the XML-descriptor – see <<gui_Action>>.

* <<datasources,Datasources>> defined in the XML-descriptor. If the attribute type is derived from `Datasource`, the system will search for a datasource with the corresponding name in the current screen.

* `UserSession`. If the attribute type is <<userSession,UserSession>>, the system will inject an object of the current user session.

* `DsContext`. If the attribute type is `DsContext`, the system will inject the `DsContext` of the current screen.

* `WindowContext`. If the attribute type is `WindowContext`, the system will inject the `WindowContext` of the current screen. 

* `DataSupplier`. If the attribute type is <<dataSupplier,DataSupplier>>, the corresponding instance will be injected.

* Any bean defined in the context of a given client block, including:

**  Middleware <<services,services>> imported by Client

** <<uiComponents,UiComponents>>

** `WindowConfig`

** `ExportDisplay`

** <<background_tasks,BackgroundWorker>>

* If nothing of the mentioned above is appropriate and the controller has <<companions,companions>>, a companion for the current client type will be injected, if the types match.

[[screen_controller_injection_params]]
It is possible to inject parameters passed in a map to the `init()` method into the controller using `@WindowParam` annotation. The annotation has the `name` attribute which contains the parameter name (a key in the map) and an optional required attribute. If `required = true` and the map does not contain the corresponding parameter a `WARNING` message is added to the log.

An example of the injection of a `Job` entity passed to the controller's `init()` method:
