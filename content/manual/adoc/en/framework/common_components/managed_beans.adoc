[[managed_beans]]
==== Spring Beans

_Spring Beans_ are classes that are instantiated and populated with dependencies by the Spring Framework container. Beans are designed for implementation of the application's business logic.

[TIP]
====
Spring Bean is a _singleton_ by default, i.e., only one instance of such class exists in each application block. If a singleton bean contains mutable data in its fields (in other words, has a state), it is necessary to synchronize access to these fields.
