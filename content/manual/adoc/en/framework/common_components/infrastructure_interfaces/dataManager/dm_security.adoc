====== Security in DataManager

The `load()`, `loadList()`, `loadValues()` and `getCount()` methods check user's READ <<permissions,permission>> for entities being loaded. Additionally, loading entities from the database is subject for access group <<constraints,constraints>>.

The `commit()` method checks CREATE permissions for new entities, UPDATE for the updated entities and DELETE for the deleted ones.

By default, `DataManager` checks permissions on entity operations (READ/CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) when invoked from a client, and ignores them when invoked from a middleware code. Attribute permissions are not enforced by default.

If you want to check entity operation permissions when using `DataManager` in your middleware code, obtain a wrapper via `DataManager.secure()` method and call its methods. Alternatively, you can set the <<cuba.dataManagerChecksSecurityOnMiddleware,cuba.dataManagerChecksSecurityOnMiddleware>> application property to turn on security check for the whole application.

Attribute permissions will be enforced on the middleware only if you additionally set the <<cuba.entityAttributePermissionChecking,cuba.entityAttributePermissionChecking>> application property to true. It makes sense if Middleware serves remote clients that theoretically can be hacked, like a desktop client. In this case, set also the <<cuba.keyForSecurityTokenEncryption,cuba.keyForSecurityTokenEncryption>> application property to a unique value. If your application uses only Web or Portal clients, you can safely keep default values of these properties.

Note that access group <<constraints,constraints>> (row-level security) are always applied regardless of the above conditions.

See also the <<data_access_checks>> section for the whole picture of how security permissions and constraints are used by different mechanisms of the framework.
