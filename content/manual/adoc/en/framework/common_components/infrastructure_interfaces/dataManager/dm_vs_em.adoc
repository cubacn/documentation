====== DataManager vs. EntityManager

Both <<dataManager,DataManager>> and <<entityManager,EntityManager>> can be used for CRUD operations on entities. There are the following differences between these interfaces:

|===
|DataManager |EntityManager

|DataManager is available on both middle and client <<app_tiers,tiers>>.
|EntityManager is available only on the middle tier.

|DataManager is a singleton bean. It can be injected or obtained via `AppBeans.get()`.
|You should obtain a reference to EntityManager through the <<persistence,Persistence>> interface.

|DataManager defines a few high-level methods for working with <<entity_states,detached>> entities: `load()`, `loadList()`, `reload()`, `commit()`.
|EntityManager mostly resembles the standard `javax.persistence.EntityManager`.

|DataManager can perform <<bean_validation,bean validation>> when saving entities.
|EntityManager doesn't perform bean validation.

|===

DataManager in fact delegates to <<data_store,DataStore>> implementations, so the DataManager features listed below apply only to the most common case when you work with entities located in a relational database:

|===
|DataManager |EntityManager

|DataManager always starts new <<transactions,transactions>> internally. On the middle tier, you can use <<transactionalDataManager,TransactionalDataManager>> if you need to implement complex transactional behavior.
|You have to open a transaction before working with EntityManager.

|DataManager loads _partial_ entities according to <<views,views>>. There are a few exceptions, see details <<dm_partial_entities,here>>.
|EntityManager loads all local attributes. If a view is specified, it affects only reference attributes. See details <<em_partial_entities,here>>.

|DataManager executes only JPQL queries. Besides, it has separate methods for loading entities: `load()`, `loadList()`; and scalar values and aggregates: `loadValues()`.
|EntityManager can run any JPQL or native (SQL) queries.

|DataManager checks <<dm_security,security>> restrictions when invoked on the client tier.
|EntityManager does not impose security restrictions.

|===

When you work with data on the client tier, you have only one option - `DataManager`. On the middleware, use `TransactionalDataManager` when you need to implement some atomic logic inside a transaction or `EntityManager` if it is better suited to the task. In general, on the middleware you can use any of these interfaces.

If you need to overcome restrictions of `DataManager` when working on the client tier, create your own <<services,service>> and use `TransactionalDataManager` or `EntityManager` to work with data. In the service, you can check permissions using the <<security,Security>> interface and return data to the client in the form of persistent or non-persistent entities or arbitrary values.
