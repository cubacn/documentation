This interface provides authorization â€“ checking user access rights to different objects in the system. Most of the interface methods delegate to the corresponding methods of current <<userSession,UserSession>> object, but before this they search for an original meta-class of the entity, which is important for projects with <<extension,extensions>>. Besides methods duplicating `UserSession` functionality, this interface contains `isEntityAttrReadPermitted()` and `isEntityAttrUpdatePermitted()` methods that check attribute path availability with respect to availability of all attributes and entities included in the path.

The `Security` interface is recommended to use everywhere instead of direct calling of the `UserSession.isXYXPermitted()` methods.

See more in <<authentication>>.
