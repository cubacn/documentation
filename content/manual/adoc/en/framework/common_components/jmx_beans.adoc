==== JMX Beans

Sometimes, it is necessary to give system administrator an ability to view and change the state of some <<managed_beans,Spring bean>> at runtime. In such case, it is recommended to create a JMX bean â€“ a program component having the <<jmx, JMX>> interface. JMX bean is usually a wrapper delegating calls to the managed bean which actually maintains state: cache, configuration data or statistics.

As you can see from the diagram, the JMX bean consists of the interface and the implementation class. The class should be a <<managed_beans,Spring bean>>, i.e., should have the `@Component` annotation and unique name. The interface of the JMX bean is registered in <<spring.xml,spring.xml>> in a special way to create the JMX interface in the current JVM.

Calls to all JMX bean interface methods are intercepted using Spring AOP by the `MBeanInterceptor` <<interceptor, interceptor>> class, which sets the correct `ClassLoader` in the current thread and enables logging of unhandled exceptions.

[WARNING]
====
The JMX bean interface name must conform to the following format: `++{class_name}MBean++`.
====

JMX-interface can be utilized by external tools, such as *jconsole* or *jvisualvm*. In addition, the Web Client platform block includes the <<jmx_console,JMX console>>, which provides the basic tools to view the status and call the methods of the JMX beans.
