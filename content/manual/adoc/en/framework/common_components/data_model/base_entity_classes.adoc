===== Base Entity Classes

The base entity classes and interfaces are described in detail in this section.

* `Instance` – declares the basic methods for working with objects of application domain:

** getting references to the object meta-class;

** generating the instance name;

** reading/writing attribute values by name;

** adding listeners receiving notifications about attribute changes.

* `Entity` – extends `Instance` with entity identifier; at the same time `Entity` does not define the type of the identifier leaving this option to descendants.

* `AbstractInstance` – implements the logic of working with attribute change listeners.
+
[WARNING]
====
`AbstractInstance` stores the listeners in `WeakReference`, and if there are no external references to the added listener, it will be immediately destroyed by garbage collector. Normally, attribute change listeners are <<gui_vcl,visual components >> and <<datasources,UI datasources>> that are always referenced by other objects, so there is no problem with listeners dropout. However, if a listener is created by application code and no objects refer to it in a natural way, it is necessary to save it in a certain object field apart from just adding it to `Instance`.
====

* `BaseGenericIdEntity` – base class of persistent and non-persistent entities. It implements `Entity` but does not specify the type of the identifier (i.e. the primary key) of the entity.

* `EmbeddableEntity` - base class of embeddable persistent entities.

Below we consider base classes recommended for inheriting your entities from. Non-persistent entities should be inherited from the same base classes as persistent ones. The framework determines if the entity is persistent or not by the file where it is registered: <<persistence.xml>> or <<metadata.xml>>.

StandardEntity::
Inherit from `StandardEntity` if you want a standard set of features: the primary key of UUID type, the instances have information on who and when created and modified them, require optimistic locking and soft deletion.

* `HasUuid` – interface for entities having a globally unique identifier.

* `Versioned` – interface for entities supporting <<optimistic_locking, optimistic locking>>.

* `Creatable` – interface for entities that keep the information about when and by whom the instance was created.

* `Updatable` – interface for entities that keep the information about when and by whom the instance was last changed.

* `SoftDelete` – interface for entities supporting <<soft_deletion,soft deletion>>.

BaseUuidEntity::
Inherit from `BaseUuidEntity` if you want an entity with the primary key of UUID type but you don't need all features of `StandardEntity`. You can implement some of the interfaces `Creatable`, `Versioned`, etc. in your concrete entity class.

BaseLongIdEntity::
Inherit from `BaseLongIdEntity` or `BaseIntegerIdEntity` if you want an entity with the primary key of the `Long` or `Integer` type. You can implement some of the interfaces `Creatable`, `Versioned`, etc. in your concrete entity class. Implementing `HasUuid` is highly recommended, as it enables some optimizations and allows you to identify your instances uniquely in a distributed environment.

BaseStringIdEntity::
Inherit from `BaseStringIdEntity` if you want an entity with the primary key of the `String` type. You can implement some of the interfaces `Creatable`, `Versioned`, etc. in your concrete entity class. Implementing `HasUuid` is highly recommended, as it enables some optimizations and allows you to identify your instances uniquely in a distributed environment. The concrete entity class must have a string field annotated with the `@Id` JPA annotation.

BaseIdentityIdEntity::
Inherit from `BaseIdentityIdEntity` if you need to map the entity to a table with IDENTITY primary key. You can implement some of the interfaces `Creatable`, `Versioned`, etc. in your concrete entity class. Implementing `HasUuid` is highly recommended, as it enables some optimizations and allows you to identify your instances uniquely in a distributed environment. The `id` attribute of the entity (i.e. `getId()`/`setId()` methods) will be of type `IdProxy` which is designed to substitute the real identifier until it is generated by the database on insert.

BaseIntIdentityIdEntity::
Inherit from `BaseIntIdentityIdEntity` if you need to map the entity to a table with IDENTITY primary key of `Integer` type (compared to `Long` in `BaseIdentityIdEntity`). In other respects, `BaseIntIdentityIdEntity` is similar to `BaseIdentityIdEntity`.

++++

BaseGenericIdEntity::
Inherit from `BaseGenericIdEntity` directly if you need to map the entity to a table with a composite key. In this case, the concrete entity class must have a field of the embeddable type representing the key, annotated with the `@EmbeddedId` JPA annotation.
