===== MySQL Database Specifics

[WARNING]

For the databases with the charset different from UTF-8, the framework scripts with constraints cannot be executed. In this case, modify the _Charset_ and _Collation name_ database properties by setting the following parameters in the *Connection params* field of the *Data Store Properties* window:

MySQL does not support partial indexes, so the only way to implement a unique constraint for a <<soft_deletion,soft deleted>> entity is to use the `DELETE_TS` column in the index. But there is another problem: MySQL allows multiple NULLs in a column with a unique constraint. Since the standard `DELETE_TS` column is nullable, it cannot be used in the unique index. We recommend the following workaround for creating unique constraints for soft deleted entities:

. Create a `DELETE_TS_NN` column in the database table. This column is not null and is initialized by a default value:
+
[source, sql]
----
create table DEMO_CUSTOMER (
    ...
    DELETE_TS_NN datetime(3) not null default '1000-01-01 00:00:00.000',
    ...
)
----

. Create a trigger that will change `DELETE_TS_NN` value when `DELETE_TS` value is changed:
+
[source, sql]
----
create trigger DEMO_CUSTOMER_DELETE_TS_NN_TRIGGER before update on DEMO_CUSTOMER
for each row
    if not(NEW.DELETE_TS <=> OLD.DELETE_TS) then
        set NEW.DELETE_TS_NN = if (NEW.DELETE_TS is null, '1000-01-01 00:00:00.000', NEW.DELETE_TS);
    end if
----

. Create a unique index including unique columns and `DELETE_TS_NN`:
+
[source, sql]
----
create unique index IDX_DEMO_CUSTOMER_UNIQ_NAME on DEMO_CUSTOMER (NAME, DELETE_TS_NN)
----
