===== The Structure of SQL Scripts

Database migration SQL scripts are text files with a set of DDL and DML commands separated by the "^" character. The "^" character is used, so that the ";" separator can be applied as part of complex commands; for example, when creating functions or triggers. The script execution mechanism splits the input file into separate commands using the "^" separator and executes each command in a separate transaction. This means that, if necessary, it is possible to group several single statements (e.g., `insert`), separated by semicolons and ensure that they execute in a single transaction.

[TIP]
====
The "^" delimiter can be escaped by doubling it. For example, if you want to pass `^[0-9\s]+$` to a statement, the script should contain `^^[0-9\s]+$`.
