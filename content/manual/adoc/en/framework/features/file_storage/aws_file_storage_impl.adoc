===== Amazon S3 File Storage Implementation

The standard file storage implementation can be replaced by a cloud storage service. We recommend to use separate cloud file storage services for cloud deployments which, commonly, don't guarantee the persistence of external files on their hard drives.

The https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-aws[AWS Filestorage] add-on provides support of Amazon S3 file storage service out-of-the-box. To support other services, you need to implement your custom logic.

To use Amazon S3 support in your application follow installation and configuration instructions in https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-aws/blob/master/README.md[README].

The storage folder structure is organized similarly to the <<file_storage_impl,standard implementation>>.
