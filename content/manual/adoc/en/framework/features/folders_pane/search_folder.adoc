===== Search Folders

Search folders can be created by the users similar to application folders. Group folders are created directly via the context menu of the <<folders_pane,folder panel>>. The folders connected to screens are created from the *Filter...* button menu, using the Save as search folder option.

Creating global search folders, requires the user to have *Create/modify global search folders* <<permissions,permission>> (`cuba.gui.searchFolder.global`). Such permission is set in the <<roles,role>> edit screen on the **Specific** tab.

Search folder's filter can be edited once the folder is created by opening the folder and changing the *Folder:{folder name}* filter. Saving the filter will change the folder filter as well.

Search folders are instances of the `SearchFolder` entity stored in the related *SYS_FOLDER* and *SEC_SEARCH_FOLDER* tables.
