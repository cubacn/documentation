[[link_to_screen]]
==== Screen Links

[WARNING]
====
See <<url_history_navigation>> section which describes more advanced feature of mapping URL to application screens.
====

The Web Client <<app_tiers,block>> enables opening application screens by commands provided in the URL. If the browser does not have an active session with a logged in user, the application will show the login screen first, and then, after successful authentication, proceed to the main application window with the requested screen.

The list of supported commands is defined by the <<cuba.web.linkHandlerActions,cuba.web.linkHandlerActions>> application property. By default, these are `open` and `o`. When the HTTP request is being processed, the last part of the URL is analyzed, and if it matches a registered command, control is passed to an appropriate processor, which is a bean implementing the `LinkHandlerProcessor` interface.

The platform provides a processor that accepts the following request parameters:

* `screen` – name of the screen defined in <<screens.xml,screens.xml>>, for example:
+
[source, url]
----
http://localhost:8080/app/open?screen=sec$User.browse
----

* `item` – an entity instance to be passed to the <<screen_edit,edit screen>>, encoded according to conventions of the `EntityLoadInfo` class, i.e. `entityName-instanceId` or `entityName-instanceId-viewName`. Examples:
+
[source, url]
----
http://localhost:8080/app/open?screen=sec$User.edit&item=sec$User-60885987-1b61-4247-94c7-dff348347f93

http://localhost:8080/app/open?screen=sec$User.edit&item=sec$User-60885987-1b61-4247-94c7-dff348347f93-user.edit
----
+
In order to create a new entity instance directly in the opened editor screen, add the `NEW-` prefix before the entity class name, for example:
+
[source, plain]
----
http://localhost:8080/app/open?screen=sec$User.edit&item=NEW-sec$User
----

* `params` – parameters passed to the screen <<screen_controller,controller's>> `init()` method. Parameters are encoded as `name1:value1,name2:value2`. Parameter values may include entity instances encoded according to the conventions of the `EntityLoadInfo` class. Examples:
+
[source, url]
----
http://localhost:8080/app/open?screen=sales$Customer.lookup&params=p1:v1,p2:v2

http://localhost:8080/app/open?screen=sales$Customer.lookup&params=p1:sales$Customer-01e37691-1a9b-11de-b900-da881aea47a6

If you want to provide additional URL commands, do the following:

* Create a <<managed_beans,bean>> implementing the `LinkHandlerProcessor` interface in the *web* module of your project.

* The `canHandle()` method of your bean must return true if the current URL, which parameters are passed in the `ExternalLinkContext` object, should be processed by your bean.

* In the `handle()` method, perform required actions.

Your bean can optionally implement Spring's `Ordered` interface or contain the `Order` annotation. Then you can specify the order of your bean in the chain of processors. Use the `HIGHEST_PLATFORM_PRECEDENCE` and `LOWEST_PLATFORM_PRECEDENCE` constants of the `LinkHandlerProcessor` interface to put your bean before or after processors defined in the platform. So if you specify the order lesser than `HIGHEST_PLATFORM_PRECEDENCE`, your bean will be requested earlier and you can override actions defined by a platform processor if needed.
