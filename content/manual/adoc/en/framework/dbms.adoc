=== Databases
This section provides information on how to configure database connections and work with particular types of DBMS. It also describes a database migration mechanism, which enables creating a new database and keeping it up-to-date throughout the entire cycle of the development and operation of the application.

Database-related components belong to the Middleware <<app_tiers,block>>; other blocks of the application do not have direct access to the database.
