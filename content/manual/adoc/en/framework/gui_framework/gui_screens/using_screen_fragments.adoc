===== Using Screen Fragments

In this section, we explain how to define and use <<screen_controllers,screen fragments>>. See also <<screen_fragment_events>> for how to handle fragment lifecycle events.

[[using_screen_fragment_decl]]
Declarative usage of a fragment::
+
--
Suppose we have a fragment for entering an address:

.AddressFragment.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_1.java[]
----

.address-fragment.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_1.xml[]
----

Then we can include it to another screen using the `fragment` element with the `screen` attribute pointing to the fragment id, specified in its `@UiController` annotation:

.host-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_1.xml[]
----

The `fragment` element can be added to any UI-container of the screen, including the top-level `layout` element.
--

[[using_screen_fragment_prog]]
Programmatic usage of a fragment::
+
--
The <<using_screen_fragment_decl,same fragment>> can be included in the screen programmatically in a <<screen_InitEvent,InitEvent>> or <<screen_AfterInitEvent,AfterInitEvent>> handler as follows:

.host-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_2.xml[]
----

.HostScreen.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_2.java[]
----
<1> - inject the `Fragments` bean which is designed to instantiate screen fragments
<2> - create the fragment's controller by its class
<3> - get the `Fragment` visual component from the controller and add it to a UI-container


[WARNING]
====
If the fragment has parameters, you can set them via public setters prior to adding the fragment to the screen. Then the parameters will be available in `InitEvent` and `AfterInitEvent` handlers of the fragment controller.
====

--

[[using_screen_fragment_params]]
Passing parameters to fragments::
+
--
A fragment controller can have public setters to accept parameters as it is done when <<screen_parameters,opening screens>>. If the fragment is opened programmatically, the setters can be invoked explicitly:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_3.java[]
----
<1> - pass a parameter before adding the fragment to the screen.

If the fragment is added to the screen declaratively in XML, use `properties` element to pass the parameters, for example:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_4.xml[]
----
<1> - pass a string parameter to `setStrParam()` method.
<2> - pass a data container to `setDataContainerParam()` method.
<3> - pass the `TextField` component to `setComponentParam()` method.

Use the `value` attribute to specify values and the `ref` attribute to specify identifiers of the screen components. Setters must have parameters of appropriate types.
--

[[using_screen_fragment_data]]
Data components in screen fragments::
+
--
A screen fragment can have its own data containers and loaders, defined in the `data` XML element. At the same time, the framework creates a single instance of <<gui_DataContext,DataContext>> for the screen and all its fragments. Therefore all loaded entities are merged to the same context and their changes are saved when the host screen is committed.

In the following example, we consider usage of own data containers and loaders in a screen fragment.

Suppose we have a `City` entity and in the fragment, instead of the text field, we want to show a drop-down list with available cities. We can define data components in the fragment descriptor as we would in a regular screen:

.address-fragment.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_2.xml[]
----

In order to load data in the fragment when the host screen is opened, we need to subscribe to the screen's event:

.AddressFragment.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_2.java[]
----
<1> - subscribing to <<screen_BeforeShowEvent,BeforeShowEvent>> of the host screen

[WARNING]
====
The `@LoadDataBeforeShow` annotation does not work for screen fragments.
====
--

[[using_screen_fragment_provided_data]]
Provided data containers::
+
--
The next example demonstrates how to use data containers of the host screen in the fragment.

.host-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_host_3.xml[]
----
<1> - data container which is used in the fragment below

.address-fragment.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/address_fragment_3.xml[]
----
<1> - `provided="true"` means that the container with the same id must exist in a host screen or enclosing fragment, i.e it must be provided from outside
<2> - UI-components are linked to the provided data container

In the XML element having `provided="true"`, all attributes except `id` are ignored but can be present to provide information for design time tools.
