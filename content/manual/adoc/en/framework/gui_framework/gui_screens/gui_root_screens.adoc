[[gui_root_screens]]
===== Root Screens

A root screen is a Generic UI screen which is displayed directly in the web browser tab. There are two types of such screens: login screen and main screen. Among other components, any root screen can contain the `WorkArea` component which enables opening other application screens in the inner tabs. If the root screen doesn't contain `WorkArea`, application screens can be opened only in `DIALOG` mode.

[[gui_LoginScreen]]
Login screen::
+
--
Login screen is displayed before a user logs in. You can customize the login screen by extending the one provided by the framework or by creating completely new screen from scratch.

In order to extend the existing screen, use *Login screen* template in Studio screen creation wizard. As a result, Studio will create a screen extending the standard login screen. This screen will be used instead of the standard one because it will have the same `login` identifier in the `@UiController` annotation.

If you want to create a new login screen from scratch, use *Blank screen* template. The source code of a minimalistic login screen may look as follows:

.my-login-screen.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/login_screen_1.xml[]
----

.MyLoginScreen.java
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/screens/login_screen_1.java[]
----

In order to use this login screen instead of the default one, set its id to the `cuba.web.loginScreenId` property in `web-app.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
cuba.web.loginScreenId = myLogin
----

You could as well give your screen the default `login` id and don't change this property.

[[gui_MainScreen]]
Main screen::
+
--
Main screen is the root application screen displayed when the user is logged in. The standard main screen with side menu provided by the framework has `main` id.

Studio has a number of templates for creating a customized main screen. All of them use the same `MainScreen` base class for controllers.

* *Main screen with side menu* creates an extension of the standard main screen with `main` id.

* *Main screen with responsive side menu* creates a similar screen, but the side menu is responsive and collapses on narrow displays. The screen will have an own generated id which must be registered in `web-app.properties`:
+
[source,properties]
----
cuba.web.mainScreenId = respSideMenuMainScreen
----

* *Main screen with top menu* creates a screen with top menu bar and ability to show <<folders_pane,folders panel>> on the left. The screen will have an own generated id which must be registered in `web-app.properties`:
+
[source,properties]
----
cuba.web.mainScreenId = topMenuMainScreen
----

The following special components may be used in the main screen in addition to the standard UI components:

* `SideMenu` – application menu in the form of the vertical tree.

* `AppMenu` – application menu bar.

* `AppWorkArea` – work area, the required component for opening screens in the `THIS_TAB`, `NEW_TAB` and `NEW_WINDOW` modes.

* `FoldersPane` – a panel for <<folders_pane,application and search folders>>.

* `UserIndicator` – the field which displays the name of the current user, as well as enables selecting substituted users, if any.
+
The `setUserNameFormatter()` method allows you to represent the user's name in a format different from the `User` instance name:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/main_window.java[]
----
+

* `NewWindowButton` – the button which opens a new main screen in a separate browser tab.

* `UserActionsButton` – if the session is not authenticated, shows the link to the login screen. Otherwise, shows the menu with the link to user settings screen and logout action.

* `LogoutButton` – the application logout button.

* `TimeZoneIndicator` – the label displaying the current user's <<timeZone,time zone>>.

* `FtsField` – the full text search field.

The following application properties may affect the main screen:

* <<cuba.web.appWindowMode,cuba.web.appWindowMode>> – sets default mode for the main window: tabbed or single screen (`TABBED` or `SINGLE`). Users can change the mode using *Settings* screen available via `UserActionsButton`.

* <<cuba.web.maxTabCount,cuba.web.maxTabCount>> – when the main window is in the tabbed mode, this property sets the maximum number of tabs that a user can open. The default value is 7.

* <<cuba.web.foldersPaneEnabled,cuba.web.foldersPaneEnabled>> - enables display of <<folders_pane,folders pane>> for a screen created by the *Main screen with top menu* template.

* <<cuba.web.defaultScreenId,cuba.web.defaultScreenId>> - specifies the default screen to be opened in the main screen automatically.

* <<cuba.web.defaultScreenCanBeClosed,cuba.web.defaultScreenCanBeClosed>> - defines whether the user can close the default screen.

* <<cuba.web.useDeviceWidthForViewport,cuba.web.useDeviceWidthForViewport>> - handles the viewport width. Set `true` if device width should be used as viewport width. The <<cuba.web.pageInitialScale,cuba.web.pageInitialScale>> property can also be useful.
