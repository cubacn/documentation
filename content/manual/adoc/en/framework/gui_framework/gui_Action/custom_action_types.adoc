===== Custom Action Types

You can create your own action types or override existing standard types in your project.

For example, imagine that you need an action that would show the instance name of the currently selected entity in a table, and you would like to use this action in multiple screens by specifying its type only. Below are the steps to create such action.

. Create an action class and add the `@ActionType` annotation with the desired type name:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/std_actions/std_actions_2.java[]
----

. In the `web-spring.xml` file, add `<gui:actions>` element with the `base-packages` attribute pointing to a package where to find your annotated actions:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/std_actions/std_actions_2_1.xml[]
----

. Now you can use the action in screen descriptors by specifying its type:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/std_actions/std_actions_2_2.xml[]
----

[TIP]
====
If you want to override an existing type, just register your new action type with the same name.
