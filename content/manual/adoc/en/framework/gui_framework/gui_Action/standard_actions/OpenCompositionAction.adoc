[[OpenCompositionAction]]
====== OpenCompositionAction

OpenCompositionAction is a <<standard_picker_actions,picker field action>> designed to open an editor screen for the one-to-one composition entity selected in the picker field. If there is no linked entity at the moment (i.e. the field is empty), a new instance is created and saved by the edit screen afterwards.

The action is implemented by `com.haulmont.cuba.gui.actions.picker.OpenCompositionAction` class and should be defined in XML using `type="picker_open_composition"` action's attribute. The action parameters are the same as for <<OpenAction>>.
