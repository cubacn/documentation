==== Anonymous Access to Screens

By default, only the login screen is available to the anonymous (not authenticated) session. By extending the login screen, you can add any information on it, or even add the `WorkArea` component and be able to open inside of it other screens available to the anonymous user. But as soon as the user logs in, all screens opened in the anonymous mode will be closed.

You may want to have some application screens to be always accessible regardless of whether the user is authenticated or not. Consider the following requirements:

* When users open the application, they see a *Welcome* screen.
* There is an *Info* screen with some publicly available information. The *Info* screen must be shown in a top level window, i.e. without main menu and other standard main window controls.
* Users can open the *Info* screen both from the *Welcome* screen and by entering an URL in web browser.
* Also from the *Welcome* screen, the user can go to login screen and continue working with the rest of the system as authenticated user.

Implementation steps are described below.

. Create the *Info* screen and annotate its controller with `@Route` to be able to open it using a link:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/anonymous_access/info_screen_1.xml[]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/anonymous_access/info_screen_1.java[]
----
<1> - specifies the screen's address. When the screen is opened in the top-level window (as root), its address will be like `++http://localhost:8080/app/#info++`.
--

. Extend the default main screen in the project to implement the required *Welcome* screen. Use one of the *Main screen ...* templates in the screen creation wizard in Studio, then add some components to the `initialLayout` element, for example:

include::{sourcesdir}/gui/anonymous_access/main_screen_1.xml[]

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/anonymous_access/main_screen_1.java[]
----
<1> - create `InfoScreen` and open it in the root window when the user clicks the button.

. In order to open our *Welcome* screen instead of login screen when the user enters the application, add the following properties to the `web-app.properties` file:
+

[source, properties]

include::{sourcesdir}/gui/anonymous_access/web-app.properties[]
----

. Enable *Info* screen for anonymous users: start the application, go to *Administration > Roles* and enable access to the *Info* screen for the *Anonymous* role.

As a result, when users open the application, they see the *Welcome* screen:

Users can open *Info* screen without authentication or click the login button to enter the secured part of the application.
