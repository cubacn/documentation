===== ScreenDependencyUtils

The simple way to add dependencies such as CSS, JavaScript or HTML to the current page for screens and fragments is to use the `ScreenDependencyUtils` helper class.  You can obtain dependencies from the following sources:

* <<using_webjars,WebJar resource>> - starts with `webjar://`
* File placed within VAADIN directory - starts with `vaadin://`
* Web resource - starts with `http://` or `https://`

This helper class has the following methods for adding and getting dependencies:

* `setScreenDependencies` - sets a list of dependencies.
* `addScreenDependencies` - adds dependencies paths.
* `addScreenDependency` - adds a dependency path.
* `List<ClientDependency> getScreenDependencies` - returns a list of previously added dependencies.

In the example a CSS file is added to the login screen: 

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/helperScreenDependencyUtils.java[]
----

As the result the following import will be added to the page header:

[source, html]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui/helperScreenDependencyUtils.html[]
----

Added CSS file is being applied only to the login screen:
