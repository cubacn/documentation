The `FileUploadField` component allows a user to upload files to the server. The component can contain a caption, a link to uploaded file, and two buttons: for uploading and for clearing the selected file. When the upload button is clicked, a standard OS file picker window is shown, where the user can select a file. In order to upload multiple files, use <<gui_FileMultiUploadField,FileMultiUploadField>>.

XML name of the component: `upload`.

////
* `FileUploadField` is automatically used inside <<gui_FieldGroup,FieldGroup>> for entity attributes of type `FileDescriptor`. In this case, the field looks as shown above and does not require additional configuration. An uploaded file is immediately stored in <<file_storage,file storage>> and the corresponding `FileDescriptor` instance is saved to the database.

* You can use the component outside `FieldGroup` and connect it to a datasource. For example, here we suppose that the `personDs` datasource contains an entity with the `photo` attribute which is a reference to `FileDescriptor`:
////

For entity attributes of `FileDescriptor` type, the component can be used inside <<gui_FieldGroup,FieldGroup>> with <<gui_attr_datasource,datasource>> attribute, inside <<gui_Form,Form>> with <<gui_attr_dataContainer,dataContainer>> attribute, or independently. If the component is bound to any data component, the uploaded file is immediately stored in <<file_storage,file storage>> and the corresponding `FileDescriptor` instance is saved to the database.

You can also control the saving of file and `FileDescriptor` programmatically:

* Declare the component in an XML screen descriptor:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/upload_1.xml[]
---- 

[[gui_FileUploadField_FileUploadSucceedListener]]
* In the screen controller, inject the component itself, the <<file_upload,FileUploadingAPI>> and <<dataSupplier,DataSupplier>> interfaces. Subscribe to the the `InitEvent` and add listeners which will react on successful uploads and errors:
+
[source, java]

include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/upload_2.java[]

<1> Here you can get the file uploaded to the temporary storage if you need it.
<2> Normally, you would want to save the file to the file storage of the middle tier.
<3> Save file to FileStorage.
<4> Save file descriptor to database.

The component will upload the file to the temporary storage of the client <<app_tiers,tier>> and invoke the listener added by the `addFileUploadSucceedListener()` method. In this listener, a `FileDescriptor` object is requested from the component. `com.haulmont.cuba.core.entity.FileDescriptor` is a persistent entity, which uniquely identifies an uploaded file and is used to download the file from the system.

`FileUploadingAPI.putFileIntoStorage()` method is used to move the uploaded file from the temporary client storage to <<file_storage,FileStorage>>. Parameters of this method are temporary storage file identifier and the `FileDescriptor` object. Both of these parameters are provided by `FileUploadField`.

After uploading the file to `FileStorage`, the `FileDescriptor` instance is saved in the database by invoking `DataSupplier.commit()`. The saved instance returned by this method can be set to an attribute of an entity related to this file. Here, `FileDescriptor` is simply stored in the database. The file will be available through the *Administration > External Files* screen.

The listener added by the `addFileUploadErrorListener()` method will be invoked if an error occurs when uploading a file to the temporary storage of the client tier.

Below is the list of listeners available to track the upload process:

[[gui_FileUploadField_AfterValueClearListener]]
* `AfterValueClearListener`,

[[gui_FileUploadField_BeforeValueClearListener]]
* `BeforeValueClearListener`,

[[gui_FileUploadField_FileUploadErrorListener]]
* `FileUploadErrorListener`,

[[gui_FileUploadField_FileUploadFinishListener]]
* `FileUploadFinishListener`

[[gui_FileUploadField_FileUploadStartListener]]
* `FileUploadStartListener`,

[[gui_FileUploadField_FileUploadSucceedListener]]
* `FileUploadSucceedListener`,

* `ValueChangeListener`.

`fileUploadField` attributes:

[[gui_FileUploadField_fileStoragePutMode]]
* `fileStoragePutMode` - defines how the file and the corresponding `FileDescriptor` are stored.
+
--
* In the `IMMEDIATE` mode it is done right after uploading file to the temporary storage of the client tier.

* In the `MANUAL` mode, you should do it programmatically in a `FileUploadSucceedListener`.

The `IMMEDIATE` mode is selected by default when `FileUploadField` is used inside `FieldGroup`. Otherwise, the default mode is `MANUAL`.
--

[[gui_FileUploadField_uploadButtonCaption]]
* `uploadButtonCaption`, `uploadButtonIcon` and `uploadButtonDescription` XML attributes allow you to set the properties of the upload button.

[[gui_FileUploadField_showFileName]]
* `showFileName` - controls whether the name of uploaded file is displayed next to upload button. It is `false` by default.

[[gui_FileUploadField_showClearButton]]
* `showClearButton` - controls whether the clear button is visible. It is `false` by default.

[[gui_FileUploadField_clearButtonCaption]]
* `clearButtonCaption`, `clearButtonIcon` and `clearButtonDescription` XML attributes allow you to set the properties of the clear button if it is visible.

[[gui_FileUploadField_accept]]
* The `accept` XML attribute (and the corresponding `setAccept()` method) can be used to set the file type mask in the file selection dialog. Users still be able to change the mask to "All files" and upload arbitrary files.
+
The value of the attribute should be a comma-separated list of masks. For example: `++*.jpg,*.png++`.

* Maximum upload size is determined by the <<cuba.maxUploadSizeMb,cuba.maxUploadSizeMb>> application property and is  20MB by default. If a user selects a file of a larger size, a corresponding message will be displayed, and the upload will be interrupted.

[[gui_FileUploadField_fileSizeLimit]]
* The `fileSizeLimit` XML attribute (and the corresponding `setFileSizeLimit()` method) can be used to set maximum allowed file size specified in bytes.

[[gui_FileUploadField_permittedExtensions]]
* The `permittedExtensions` XML attribute (and the corresponding `setPermittedExtensions()` method) sets the white list of permitted file extensions.
+
The value of the attribute should be a comma-separated list of extensions with leading dots. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
uploadField.setPermittedExtensions(Sets.newHashSet(".png", ".jpg"));
----

[[gui_FileUploadField_dropZone]]
* `dropZone` - allows you to specify a <<gui_BoxLayout,BoxLayout>> to be used as a target for drag-and-dropping files from outside of the browser. The dropZone can cover the whole layout of a dialog window. The selected container is highlighted when a user drags a file over the container, otherwise it is not visible.
+
[source, xml]

include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/dropZone.xml[]
----
+

+
To make a dropZone static and display it permanently, assign the predefined `dropzone-container` style to its container. In this case the container should be empty with only the `label` component inside:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/dropzone_static.xml[]
----
+
image::gui_dropZone_static.png[align="center"]

[[gui_FileUploadField_pasteZone]]
* `pasteZone` allows you to specify a <<gui_layouts,container>> to be used for handling paste shortcuts when a text input field nested in this container is focused. This feature is supported by Chromium-based browsers.
