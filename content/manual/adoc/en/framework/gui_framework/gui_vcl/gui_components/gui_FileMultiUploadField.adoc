The `FileMultiUploadField` component allows a user to upload files to the server. The component is a button; when it is clicked, a standard OS file picker window is shown, where the user can select multiple files for upload.

XML name of the component: `multiUpload`.

Below is an example of using `FileMultiUploadField`.

* Declare the component in an XML screen descriptor: 
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/multiupload_1.xml[]
----

* In the screen controller, inject the component itself, the <<file_upload,FileUploadingAPI>> and <<dataManager,DataManager>> interfaces.
+
--
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/multiupload_2.java[]
----

<1> In the `onInit()` method, add listeners which will react on successful uploads and errors.

<2> The component uploads all selected files to the temporary storage of the client <<app_tiers,tier>> and invokes the listener added by the `addQueueUploadCompleteListener()` method.

<3> In this listener, the `FileMultiUploadField.getUploadsMap()` method is invoked to obtain a map of temporary storage file identifiers to file names.

<4> Then, corresponding `FileDescriptor` objects are created by calling `FileUploadingAPI.getFileDescriptor()` for each map entry. `com.haulmont.cuba.core.entity.FileDescriptor` (do not confuse with `java.io.FileDescriptor`) is a persistent entity, which uniquely identifies an uploaded file and then is used to download the file from the system.

<5> `FileUploadingAPI.putFileIntoStorage()` method is used to move the uploaded file from the temporary client storage to <<file_storage,FileStorage>>. Parameters of this method are temporary storage file identifier and the `FileDescriptor` object.

<6> After uploading the file to `FileStorage`, the `FileDescriptor` instance is saved in a database by invoking `DataManager.commit()`. The saved instance returned by this method can be set to an attribute of an entity related to this file. Here, `FileDescriptor` is simply stored in the database. The file will be available through the *Administration > External Files* screen.

<7> After processing, the list of files should be cleared by calling the `clearUploads()` method in order to prepare for further uploads.

Below is the list of listeners available to track the upload process:

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_FileUploadErrorListener]]
* `FileUploadErrorListener`,

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_FileUploadStartListener]]
* `FileUploadStartListener`,

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_FileUploadFinishListener]]
* `FileUploadFinishListener`,

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_QueueUploadCompleteListener]]
* `QueueUploadCompleteListener`.

Maximum upload size is determined by the <<cuba.maxUploadSizeMb,cuba.maxUploadSizeMb>> application property and is  20MB by default. If a user selects a file of a larger size, a corresponding message will be displayed, and the upload will be interrupted.

`multiUpload` attributes:

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_accept]]
* The `accept` XML attribute (and the corresponding `setAccept()` method) can be used to set the file type mask in the file selection dialog. Users still be able to change the mask to "All files" and upload arbitrary files.
+
The value of the attribute should be a comma-separated list of masks. For example: `++*.jpg,*.png++`.

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_fileSizeLimit]]
* The `fileSizeLimit` XML attribute (and the corresponding `setFileSizeLimit()` method) can be used to set maximum allowed file size in bytes. This limit defines a maximum size for each file.
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/multiupload_3.xml[]
----

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_permittedExtensions]]
* The `permittedExtensions` XML attribute (and the corresponding `setPermittedExtensions()` method) sets the white list of permitted file extensions.
+
The value of the attribute should be a set of string values, where each string is a permitted extension with leading dot. For example:
+
[source,java]
----
uploadField.setPermittedExtensions(Sets.newHashSet(".png", ".jpg"));
----

[[gui_FileMultiUploadField_dropZone]]
* The `dropZone` XML attribute allows you to specify a <<gui_BoxLayout,BoxLayout>> to be used as a target for drag-and-dropping files from outside of the browser. If the container style <<gui_FileUploadField_dropZone,is not set>>, the selected container is highlighted when a user drags files over the container, otherwise the dropZone is not visible.

See <<images_recipe>> for more complex example of working with uploaded files.
