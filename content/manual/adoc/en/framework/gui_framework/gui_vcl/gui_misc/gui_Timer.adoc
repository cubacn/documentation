Timer is a non-visual component allowing certain screen controller code to be run at specified time intervals. The timer works in a thread that handles user interface events, therefore it can update screen components. Timer stops working when a screen it was created for gets closed.

The main approach for creating timers is by declaring them in a screen XML-descriptor – in the `timers` element which is located between `dsContext` and `layout` elements.

Timers are described using the `timer` element.

* `delay` is a required attribute; it defines timer interval in milliseconds.

* `autostart` – an optional attribute; when it is set to `true`, timer starts immediately after the screen gets opened. By default the value is `false`, which means that the timer will be started by invoking its `start()` method.

* `repeating` – an optional attribute, turns on repeating executions of the timer. If the attribute is set to `true`, the timer runs in cycles at equal intervals defined in the `delay` attribute. Otherwise, the timer runs only once – `delay` milliseconds after the timer start.

* `onTimer` – optional attribute containing a name of a method called when the timer fires. The handling method should be defined in a screen controller with the `public` modifier and have one parameter of type `com.haulmont.cuba.gui.components.Timer`.

An example of using a timer to refresh table content periodically:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/timer_1.xml[]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/timer_2.java[]
----

A timer can be injected into a controller field, or acquired using the `Window.getTimer()` method. Timer execution can be controlled using the timer's `start()` and `stop()` methods. For an already active timer, `start()` invocation will be ignored. After stopping the timer using `stop()` method, it can be started again with `start()`.

Example of defining a timer in an XML descriptor and using timer listeners in a controller:

[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/timer_3.xml[]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/timer_4.java[]
----

<1> timer execution handler

<2> timer stop event

<3> start the timer

A timer can be created in a controller, in this case it should be added to the screen implicitly using the `addTimer()` method, for example:

[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/gui_vcl/timer_5.java[]
----

<1> add timer to the screen

<2> set timer parameters

<3> add execution handler

<4> add stop listener

<5> start the timer
