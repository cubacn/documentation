[[persistenceTools]]
===== PersistenceTools

A <<managed_beans,Spring bean>> containing helper methods related to data storage functionality. It can be obtained either by calling the `Persistence.getTools()` method or like any other bean, through injection or the `AppBeans` class.

The `PersistenceTools` bean has the following methods:

* `getDirtyFields()` – returns a collection of entity attribute names that have been changed since the last load of the instance from the DB. For new instances an empty collection is returned.

* `isLoaded()` – determines if the specified instance attribute was loaded from the DB. The attribute may not be loaded, if it was not present in the <<views,view>> specified when loading the instance. 
+
This method only works for instances in the <<entity_states,Managed>> state.

* `getReferenceId()` – returns an ID of the related entity without loading it from the DB.
+
Let us suppose that an `Order` instance was loaded in the <<persistence_context, persistent context>> and it is necessary to get the ID value of the `Customer` instance related to this `Order`. A call to the `order.getCustomer().getId()` method will execute the DB query to load the `Customer` instance, which in this case is unnecessary, because the value of the Customer ID is also located in the `Order` table as a foreign key. Whereas the execution of

will not send any additional queries to the database.

This method works only for instances in the <<entity_states,Managed>> state.

The `PersistenceTools` bean can be <<bean_extension,overridden>> in your application to extend the set of default helper methods. An example of working with the extended interface is shown below:
