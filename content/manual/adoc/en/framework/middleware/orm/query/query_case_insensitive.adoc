[[query_case_insensitive]]
====== Case-Insensitive Substring Search

You can use the `(?i)` prefix in the value of the query parameters to conveniently specify conditions for case insensitive search by any part of the string. For example, look at the query:

[source, jpql]
----
select c from sales_Customer c where c.name like :name
----

If you pass the string `(?i)%doe%` as a value of the `name` parameter, the search will return `John Doe`, if such record exists in the database, even though the case of symbols is different. This will happen because ORM will run the SQL query with the condition `lower(C.NAME) like ?`.

It should be kept in mind that such search will not use index on the name field, even if such exists in the database.
