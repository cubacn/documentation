====== Macros in JPQL

JPQL query text can include macros, which are processed before the query is executed. They are converted into the executable JPQL and can additionally modify the set of query parameters.

The macros solve the following problems:

* Provide a workaround for the limitation of JPQL which makes it impossible to express the condition of dependency of a given field on current time (i.e. expressions like "current_date -1" do not work).

* Enable comparing `Timestamp` type fields (the date/time fields) with a date.

Let us consider them in more detail:

@between:: 
+
--
Has the format `++@between(field_name, moment1, moment2, time_unit)++` or `++@between(field_name, moment1, moment2, time_unit, user_timezone)++`, where

* `++field_name++` is the name of the compared attribute. 

* `moment1`, `moment2` – start and end points of the time interval where the value of `++field_name++` should fall into. Each of the points should be defined by an expression containing `now` variable with an addition or subtraction of an integer number.

* `++time_unit++` – defines the unit for time interval added to or subtracted from `now` in the time point expressions and time points rounding precision. May be one of the following: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`.

* `++user_timezone++` - an optional argument that defines the current user's <<timeZone, time zone>> to be considered in the query.

The macro gets converted to the following expression in JPQL: `++field_name >= :moment1 and field_name < :moment2++`

Example 1. Customer was created today: 

[source, jpql]
----
select c from sales_Customer where @between(c.createTs, now, now+1, day)
----

Example 2. Customer was created within the last 10 minutes:

[source, jpql]
----
select c from sales_Customer where @between(c.createTs, now-10, now, minute)
----

Example 3. Documents dated within the last 5 days, considering current user time zone:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @between(d.createTs, now-5, now, day, user_timezone)
----
--

@today:: 
+
--
Has the format `++@today(field_name)++` or `++@today(field_name, user_timezone)++` and helps to define a condition checking that the attribute value falls into the current date. Essentially, this is a special case of the `@between` macro.

Example. Customer was created today: 

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @today(d.createTs)
----
--

@dateEquals:: 
+
--
Has the format `++@dateEquals(field_name, parameter)++` or `++@dateEquals(field_name, parameter, user_timezone)++` and allows you to define a condition checking that `++field_name++` value (in `Timestamp` format) falls into the date passed as `parameter`.

Example: 

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateEquals(d.createTs, :param)
----

You can pass the current date using the `now` attribute. To set the days offset, use `now`  with `+` or `-`, for example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateEquals(d.createTs, now-1)
----
--

@dateBefore:: 
+
--
Has the format `++@dateBefore(field_name, parameter)++` or `++@dateBefore(field_name, parameter, user_timezone)++` and allows you to define a condition checking that `++field_name++` value (in `Timestamp` format) is smaller than the date passed as `parameter`.

Example: 

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateBefore(d.createTs, :param, user_timezone)
----

You can pass the current date using the `now` attribute. To set the days offset, use `now`  with `+` or `-`, for example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateBefore(d.createTs, now+1)
----
--

@dateAfter:: 
+
--
Has the format `++@dateAfter(field_name, parameter)++` or `++@dateAfter(field_name, parameter, user_timezone)++` and allows you to define a condition that the date of the `++field_name++` value (in `Timestamp` format) is more or equal to the date passed as `parameter`.

Example: 

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateAfter(d.createTs, :param)
----

You can pass the current date using the `now` attribute. To set the days offset, use `now`  with `+` or `-`, for example:

[source, jpql]
----
select d from sales_Doc where @dateAfter(d.createTs, now-1)
----
--

@enum:: 
+
--
Allows you to use a fully qualified enum constant name instead of its database identifier. This simplifies searching for enum usages throughout the application code.

Example: 

[source, jpql]
----
select r from sec$Role where r.type = @enum(com.haulmont.cuba.security.entity.RoleType.SUPER) order by r.name
----
--
