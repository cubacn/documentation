===== Declarative Transaction Management

Any method of the Middleware <<managed_beans,Spring bean>> may be annotated with `@org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional`, which will automatically create a transaction when the method is called. Such method does not require invoking `Persistence.createTransaction()`, you can immediately get `EntityManager` and work with it.

`@Transactional` annotation supports a number of parameters, including:

* `propagation` - transaction creation mode. The `REQUIRED` value corresponds to `getTransaction()`, the `REQUIRES_NEW` value â€“ to `createTransaction()`. The default value is `REQUIRED`.
+
[source, java]
----
@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
public void doSomething() {
}
----

* `value` - <<data_store,data store>> name. If omitted, the main data store is assumed. For example:
+
[source, java]
----
@Transactional("db1")
public void doSomething() {
}
----

Declarative transaction management allows you to reduce the amount of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code[boilerplate code], but it has the following drawback: transactions are committed outside of the application code, which often complicates debugging because it conceals the moment when changes are sent to the database and the entities become <<entity_states,Detached>>. Additionally, keep in mind that declarative markup will only work if the method is called by the container, i.e. calling a transaction method from another method of the same object will not start a transaction.

With this in mind, we recommend using declarative transaction management only for simple cases like a <<services,service>> method reading a certain object and returning it to the client.
