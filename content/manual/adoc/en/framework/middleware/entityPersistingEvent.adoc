==== EntityPersistingEvent

`EntityPersistingEvent` is a Spring's `ApplicationEvent` which is sent by the framework on the middle tier before a _new instance_ is saved to the database. At the moment of sending the event, an active transaction exists.

`EntityChangedEvent` can be used to initialize entity attributes before creating it in the database:
