==== Example of Application Component

In this section, we'll consider a complete example of creating an application component and using it in a project. The component will provide a "Customer Management" functionality and include the `Customer` entity and corresponding UI screens. The application will use the `Customer` entity from the component as a reference in its `Order` entity.

Creating the Customer Management component::

. Create a new project in Studio and specify the following properties on the *New project* screen:

* *Project name* – `customers`

* *Project namespace* – `cust`

* *Root package* – `com.company.customers`

. Open the *Project Properties* window and on the *Main* tab set the *Module prefix* to `cust`.

. Create the `Customer` entity with at least the `name` attribute. Specify the <<namePattern_annotation,name pattern>> in the *Instance name* field.

[WARNING]
====
If your component contains `@MappedSuperclass` persistent classes, make sure they have descendants which are entities (i.e., annotated with `@Entity`) in the same project. Otherwise, such base classes will not be properly enhanced and you will not be able to use them in applications.
====

. Generate DB scripts and create standard screens for the `Customer` entity: `cust_Customer.browse` and `cust_Customer.edit`.
. Go to the menu designer and rename the `application-cust` menu item to `customerManagement`. Then, open the `messages.properties` file in the *Main Message Pack* section and specify the new caption for the `customerManagement` menu item.
. Generate <<app-component.xml,descriptor>> `app-component.xml` by clicking the *CUBA > Advanced > App Component Descriptor* item in the main menu.
. Test the Customer Management functionality:

* Select *CUBA > Create Database* in the main menu.
* Run the application: click the debug button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar.
* Open `++http://localhost:8080/cust++` in your web browser.

. Install the application component into the local Maven repository by selecting the *CUBA > Advanced > Install App Component* menu item.

Creating the Sales application::

. Create a new project in Studio and specify the following properties on the *New project* screen:

* *Project name* – `sales`

* *Project namespace* – `sales`

* *Root package* – `com.company.sales`

. Open the *Project Properties* window and in the *Repositories* section add local Maven repository to the repositories list.

. On the *App components* panel click the plus button next to *Custom components*. In the *Custom application component* dialog, enter Maven coordinates of the Customer Management component, e.g. `com.company.customers:cust-global:0.1-SNAPSHOT`. Save the project properties by clicking *OK*. Confirm when Studio suggests changing Gradle scripts.

. Create the `Order` entity and add the `date` and `amount` attributes. Then add the `customer` attribute as a many-to-one association with the `Customer` entity – it should be available in the *Type* drop-down list.

. Generate DB scripts and create standard screens for the `Order` entity. When creating standard screens, create an `order-with-customer` view that includes the `customer` attribute and use it for the screens.

. Test the application functionality:
* Select *CUBA > Create Database* in the main menu.
* Run the application: click the debug button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar.
* Open `++http://localhost:8080/app++` in your web browser. The application will contain two top-level menu items: *Customer Management* and *Application* with the corresponding functionality.

Modifying the Customer Management component::

Suppose we have to change the component functionality (add an attribute to `Customer`) and then reassemble the application to incorporate the changes.

. Open the `customers` project in Studio.

. Edit the `Customer` entity and add the `address` attribute. Include this attribute to both browser and editor screens.

. Generate DB scripts – a script for altering table will be created. Save the scripts.

. Test the changes in the component:
* Select *CUBA > Update Database* in the main menu.
* Run the application: click the debug button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar.
* Open `++http://localhost:8080/cust++` in your web browser.

. Re-install the application component into the local Maven repository by selecting the *CUBA > Advanced > Install App Component* menu item.

. Close the `sales` project in Studio (if it is open) and open it again. This is necessary to download the new component source code in Studio.

. Select *CUBA > Build Tasks > Clean*, then *CUBA > Build Tasks > Assemble* menu items.

. Select *CUBA > Update Database* in the main menu – the update script from the Customer Management component will be executed.

. Run the application: click the debug button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar.

. Open `++http://localhost:8080/app++` in your web browser – the application will contain the `Customer` entity and screens with the new `address` attribute.
