==== Additional Data Stores in Application Component

If an application component uses an <<data_store,additional data store>>, the application must define a data store with the same name and of the same type. For example, if the component uses `db1` data store connected to a PostgreSQL database, the application must have the `db1` data store of PostgreSQL type too.

If you are using Studio, just create the additional data store as described in the {studio_man_url}/#data_stores[Studio documentation]. Otherwise, use the instructions from the <<data_store>> section.
