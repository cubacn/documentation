==== Useful Loggers

Below is a list of framework loggers that can be useful for application troubleshooting.

eclipselink.sql::
+
--
If set to `DEBUG`, the EclipseLink ORM framework logs all its SQL statements together with their execution time. The logger is already defined in the standard `logback.xml`, so you have to only change its level. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<configuration>
    ...
    <logger name="eclipselink.sql" level="DEBUG"/>
----

Example of a log output:

[source, log]

com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys.AbstractWebAppContextLoader::
+
--
If set to `TRACE`, the framework logs <<app_properties_files,application properties defined in files>> and coming from application components when the server starts, which can help in case of startup problems.

Note that you should also set an appropriate appender to `TRACE`, because usually appenders are set to a higher threshold. For example:

[source, xml]
----
<configuration>
    ...
    <appender name="File" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
        <filter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.filter.ThresholdFilter">
            <level>TRACE</level>
        </filter>
    ...
    <logger name="com.haulmont.cuba.core.sys.AbstractWebAppContextLoader" level="TRACE"/>
