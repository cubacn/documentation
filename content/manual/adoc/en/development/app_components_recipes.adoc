=== Working with Application Components

Any CUBA application can be used as a <<app_components,component>> of another application. An application component is a full-stack library providing functionality on all layers - from database schema to business logic and UI.

Application components published on https://www.cuba-platform.com/marketplace[CUBA Marketplace] are called add-ons, because they extend functionality of the framework and can be used in any CUBA-based application.
