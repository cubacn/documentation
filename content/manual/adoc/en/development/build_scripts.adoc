=== Build Scripts

Platform based projects are built using *Gradle* build system. Build scripts are two files in the project root directory:

* `settings.gradle` – defines the project name and the set of <<app_modules,modules>>.

* `build.gradle` – defines the build configuration.

This section describes the structure of the scripts and the purpose and parameters of Gradle tasks.
