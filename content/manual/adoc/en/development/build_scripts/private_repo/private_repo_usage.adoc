===== Using the Private Repository

Now your private repository is ready to use. Find the *cuba-group* URL at the top of the screen, for example:
----
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/cuba-group
----

- Find the list of registered repositories in {studio_man_url}[Studio]. If you are creating a new project, it is in the *New Project* window. For an existing project, open *CUBA > Project Properties* window.
- In the new repository dialog, enter the repository URL and credentials: `admin / admin123`.
- After saving the repository information, use it in the project by selecting its checkbox in the list.
- Save the project properties or continue with the project creation wizard.

During the first build your new repository downloads necessary artifacts and keeps them in the cache for the next usage. You may find them in `c:\nexus-2.14.3-02\sonatype-work` folder.
