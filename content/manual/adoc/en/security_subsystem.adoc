== Security Subsystem

CUBA includes a sophisticated security subsystem that solves common problems of enterprise applications:

* Authentication using built-in <<users,users>> repository, <<ldap,LDAP>>, <<sso,SSO>> or <<social_login,social networks>>.

* The <<roles,role-based>> access control for the data model (entity operations and attributes), UI screens and arbitrary named permissions. For example, John Doe can view documents, but cannot create, update or delete them. He also can view all document attributes except `amount`.

* <<constraints,Row-level>> data access control - ability to specify rights to particular entity instances. For example, John Doe can view documents that have been created in his department only.
