==== Creating the Process model

The final version of the process model will look like this:

.Process Full
image::ProcessFull.png[align="center"]

Let's take a look at the steps needed to create the model.

In the web interface of the running application, open the *BPM > Process Models* screen and click *Create*. Enter `Contract approval` for the model name and click *OK*. *Model Editor* will be opened in a new browser tab.

[TIP]
====
A notification with the clickable link is shown in case of creating or copying the process model. In case of clicking the *Edit* button, the process model editor is shown in a new tab.
====

Select the *Process roles* property in the model properties panel. The *Process roles* edit window will be opened.

.Process Roles Property
image::ProcessRolesProperty.png[align="center"]

Two types of actors participate in the process: a manager and a controller. Create two roles: `Controller` and `Manager`.

.Process Roles Editor
image::ProcessRolesEditor.png[align="center"]

Drag and drop the *Start event* node from the *Start Events* group to the workspace.

We need to display a form to select process actors when the process starts. Select the start event node. Select the *Start form* in its properties panel – a form selection window will appear. Select `Standard form` in the *Form name* field. Then add two form parameters:

* `procActorsVisible` with `true` value indicates that a table for process actors selection will be displayed on the form.
* `attachmentsVisible` with `true` value indicates that a table for uploading attachments will be displayed on the form.

.Start Form

Add the *User task* node from the *Activities* group to the model. Name it `Validation`.

.Model Validation Node
image::ModelValidationNode.png[align="center"]

Select this node and assign the `controller` value to the *Process role* property at the properties panel. This way we define that the task will be assigned to a process actor with the `controller` role.

.Select ProcRole For Validation

Next, select the *Task outcomes* property. The window for task outcomes edit will be opened. Outcomes define possible user actions when users receive tasks. Create two outcomes: `Valid` and `Not valid`. Define the `Standard form` for both outcomes. Add form parameter `commentRequired=true` for the `Not valid` outcome, because we want to make a user add a comment in case of invalid contract.

.Outcomes For Validation
image::OutcomesForValidation.png[align="center"]

Depending on the controller's decision we have to send the contract to managers approval or to finish the process with the `Not valid` state. The *Exclusive gateway* node from the *Gateways* group is used to control the process flow. Add it to the workspace and then add two more elements: *Script task* with `Set 'Not valid' state` name and *User task* with `Approval` name. Name the flow to the *Script task* as `Not valid` and the flow to the *User task* as `Valid`.

.Model Validation Exclusive Gateway
image::ModelValidationExclGateway.png[align="center"]

Select the `Not valid` flow. Expand the *Flow outcome* dropdown list from the properties panel. It shows outcomes from the tasks before the gateway. Select the `Not valid` value.

.Not Valid Flow Outcome
image::NotValidFlowOutcome.png[align="center"]

Now, if the `Not valid` outcome is selected, a transition to this flow will be performed.

The `Valid` flow should be marked as the default flow (if no other flows condition are true). Select the `Valid` flow and tick the *Default flow* property.

[WARNING]
====
There must be no value selected in the *Flow outcome* dropdown list for the flow marked as default.
====

Next, select the *Exclusive gateway* and open its *Flow order* property editor. Make sure that the `Not valid` flow is on the first place in the list. Change the flows sequence if necessary.

.Validation Flow Order

Let's move on to the `Set 'Not valid' state` node. We need to set the `state` property of the Contract entity to the `Not valid` value. Select the node. Set the *Script format* property value to `groovy`. Click on the *Script* property field – the script editor will be opened. Copy and paste the following code there:

[source,groovy]
----
def em = persistence.getEntityManager()
def contract = em.find(com.company.bpmdemo.entity.Contract.class, entityId)
contract.setState('Not valid')
----

You can use process variables and `persistence` and `metadata` platform objects (see {main_man_url}/index.html[Developer's Manual]) in scripts. The `entityId` variable is created on process start and stores an identifier of the linked entity.

After the contract state is changed, the process should be finished. Let's add the *End event* node from the *End events* group to the workspace and connect the node with the `Set 'Not valid' state`.

Let's go back to the `Approval` task. Define the `manager` process role for it as we did for the first task. In order for the task to be assigned to many managers simultaneously, set its *Multi-instance type* property to `Parallel`.

.Multi-instance Approval Type
image::ApprovalMutlInstanceType.png[align="center"]

Create two task outcomes: `Approve` and `Reject` (*Task outcomes* property). For both outcomes, set the `Standard form` form and set `commentRequired` parameter to `true` for the `Reject` outcome.

After the approval is completed, either `Approved` or `Not approved` status should be assigned to the contract depending on the approval result. Add an *Exclusive gateway* node after the `Approval task`. Add two *Service task* after the exclusive gateway: `Set 'Approved' state` and `Set 'Not approved' state`. They will do the same thing as the *Script task* we have added earlier, but in a different way: by invoking a Spring bean method. Name the flow to the `Set 'Approved' state` as `Approved`, and the flow to the `Set 'Not approved' state` as `Not approved`.

.Model With Approval
image::ModelWithApproval.png[align="center"]

Select the `Not approved` flow node and select the `Reject` value in the *Flow outcome* list. Now if at least one of the managers performs the `Reject` action then this outcome will be initiated. Select the `Approved` flow node and check the *Default flow* checkbox. This means that if no other flow is initiated then this flow will be used.

Set the flow order for *Exclusive gateway* as we did for the previous one. Select *Exclusive gateway* and open the *Flow order* property editor. `Not approved` should be processed first.

.Approval Flow Order
image::ApprovalFlowOrder.png[align="center"]

Let's go back to the Service task. Select the `Set 'Approved' state` node and set its *Expression* property to the following value:

[source,groovy]
----
${demo_ApprovalHelper.updateState(entityId, 'Approved')}
----

Apply the following script for the `Set 'Not approved' state`:

[source,groovy]
----
${demo_ApprovalHelper.updateState(entityId, 'Not approved')}
----

The Activiti engine is integrated with the Spring framework, so we can access Spring beans by their names. `entityId` is a process variable that stores an identifier of the contract which is linked to the process. Its value is set on the process start.

Connect both service tasks with the *End event* and click the save button. The model is ready, and we can move on to the model deployment.
