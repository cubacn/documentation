=== Creating the Project
. Create a new project in CUBA Studio as described in the {studio_man_url}/create_project.html[Creating a New Project] section of the {studio_man_url}/index.html[CUBA Studio User Guide]:

* Project name: `bpm-demo`
* Project namespace: `demo`
* Root package: `com.company.bpmdemo`

[start=2]
. Add the *Business Process Management* add-on to your project via CUBA *Add-Ons* window as described in the <<installation, Installation>> section.

. Create the database on the local *HyperSQL* server: select option *CUBA* > *Create database* in the main menu. The database name is the same as project namespace by default.

. Run the application: click the image:run_button.png[] button next to the selected `CUBA Application` configuration in the main toolbar. The link in the *Runs at...* section of the CUBA project tree will help to open the application in a web browser directly from Studio.

The username and password are `admin` / `admin`.

The running application contains two main menu items (*Administration* and *Help*), as well as {main_man_url}/security_subsystem.html[security] and administration subsystems functionality.
