==== Using Events

Let's consider the use of events. We will add handling of a graph item click to the screen created in <<cdb_screen_controller>>. Open the screen controller and inject the chart. In order to show a notification, inject the `Notifications` bean into the screen controller.

[source, java]
----
@Inject
private Notifications notifications;

@Inject
private SerialChart chart;
----

Then add a listener at the bottom of the `onInit` method. When a chart receives data from `DataProvider`, the `getDataItemNN()` method should be used to get the item clicked. In this example, the `SerialChart` component is bound to the data container, so another method should be used: `getEntityNN()`:

[source,java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/chart/GraphItemClickListener.java[]
----

To see the results, rebuild the project using *Run* -> *Restart application server* and log in to the system. Open the screen and click one of the columns.
