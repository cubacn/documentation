[[execution_history_protection]]
=== Protection against Expired User Session

It is not rare that a heavy SQL report takes more than 30 minutes to finish.
If the user did not perform any other activity during these 30 minutes, when the report document is ready, the {main_man_url}/userSession.html[user session] occurs to be expired.
Mechanism of report execution history recording tries to detect such situations and record execution history on behalf of the system user, even if the original userâ€™s session has been expired.
