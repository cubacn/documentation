== Report Execution History

The platform provides a mechanism of a report execution history management with the following features:

. Save execution history for each report. The system administrator can use the report execution history to find out how often a report is executed, how many seconds of processing time is spent on a report, by which user and when a report was run, what errors occurred during the execution.
. Clean outdated report execution history.

The report execution history is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the <<reporting.executionHistory.enabled,reporting.executionHistory.enabled>> application property to `true`. You can do it in the *Administration > Application Properties* screen.

The execution history screen is considered administrative and was not added to the main menu. To view the execution history, go to the reports browser (the *Reports>Reports* menu item) and click on the *Execution history* button.

If any report was selected in the *Reports* table, then the execution history is additionally filtered by the selected report.
If no reports were selected in the *Reports* table, the execution history of all system reports is displayed on the execution history screen.

"Report name" and "Report code" are denormalization fields, remembered at the execution time to keep data even after the report is deleted. "Cancelled" flag means that the user launched the report as a background task, and then canceled it.

Execution history is also recorded even for reports which are not yet saved to the database, but launched from the report editor (by clicking the *Run* button).
