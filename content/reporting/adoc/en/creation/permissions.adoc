=== Report Access Rights

You can define user rights to access the report as well as report availability in certain application screens in the *Roles and Screens* tab of the report editor.

If the report roles list contains at least one role, the report will be available only to users with this role. If no roles are specified, the report is available to everyone.

[TIP]
====
Keep in mind that in the reports browser (the *Reports->Reports* menu item) all system reports are visible because this screen is considered administrative.
====

The screens list allows to specify, which screens the report will be available in when invoking `RunReportAction`, `TablePrintFormAction` or `EditorPrintFormAction` <<run_actions, actions>>. If no screen is specified, the report won't be available from any screen.
