=== Report with Chart Output

Using the report wizard, you can create reports with <<template_chart,chart output>> in the same way as any other report types. The only difference is that you will need to configure the chart template after finishing the report in the wizard.

This example is based on the *petclinic* application, which source code is available at https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-petclinic[GitHub].

. Add the *Charts* addon to your project via **CUBA Add-Ons** window as described in the {studio_man_url}/#add_ons[Studio documentation].

. Start creating a report as described in the previous chapters.
