For an easy start, the report generator comes with the Reports wizard â€“ a visual tool for quick report creation, including both data structure and template design. Having created a report with the wizard, you can then decompose it and learn how the <<structure,datasets>> are created, explore the report <<parameters,parameters>>, modify the <<template,template>> or the <<template_to_output,output type>>, following the further sections of this manual.

To run the wizard, click *Create* -> *Using wizard* in the *Reports* screen.

Three types of reports can be created using the wizard:

. Report for a single entity.
. Report for a list of given entities.
. Report for a list of entities filtered by query.

Report design is a three steps process:

. Creating a data structure of a report.
. Editing of report regions.
. Saving the report.

The created report can be modified in the usual manner using the report editor and run through <<run_common, the generic report browser>> or using special <<run_actions,actions>> (`ListPrintFormAction`, `EditorPrintFormAction`, etc.).
