[[run_actions]]
=== Running Reports from Screens

You can run reports from arbitrary screens using special actions and associated buttons or component context menu items. In this case, the <<permissions, availability>> of the report directly in this screen is checked in addition to a user role.

Action types and examples of their use are provided below.

[[run_report_action]]
* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.list.RunReportAction` – a {main_man_url}/standard_actions.html[standard action] that displays the list of all available reports. It should be defined for a `Button` or a list component (`Table`, `DataGrid`, etc.).
+
Below is an example of using the declarative action for the `GroupTable`:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example1.xml[]
----
<1> - the `type` attribute defines a specific `runReport` action type, provided by the framework.
+
Example of programmatically creating the action together with a button declared in the screen XML descriptor:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example2.java[]
----
+
When the action is performed, a modal **Report Run** dialog will open where reports related to the current screen will be displayed. When a user selects a report from the list, the parameters input form is displayed (if any were defined) and the report is run.

[[list_print_form_action]]
* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.list.ListPrintFormAction` – a {main_man_url}/standard_actions.html[standard action] for printing reports for entity instances associated with a list component (`Table`, `DataGrid`, etc.).
+
The action only selects reports having an external parameter of the *Entity* or the *List of entities* type and where the parameter entity type matches the entity type displayed by the list component. If only one report is available as a result of selection, it is invoked immediately. If several reports are available, their list is offered to the user for selection.
+
The external parameter value is passed to the report using the following rules:

** If the parameter has the *List of entities* type, the list of instances currently selected in the list component is passed into it.

** If the parameter has the *Entity* type, and the list component has a single instance selected (one row is highlighted), then this instance is passed into the report.

** If the parameter is of the *Entity* type, and the list component has several rows selected, then the report runs several times according to the number of selected instances. After execution, the user gets a single ZIP archive containing all generated reports.

Below is an example of using the declarative action for the `GroupTable`:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example5.xml[]
----
<1> - the `type` attribute defines a specific `listPrintForm` action type, provided by the framework.
+
Example of programmatically creating the action together with a button declared in the screen XML descriptor:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example6.java[]
----
+
When the action is performed, if no entities were selected from the list component, a confirmation window will be displayed.

+
After that, the modal **Run reports** dialog will open where reports related to the current screen will be displayed. From this modal screen, the user can run some report for the selected entity.

[[editor_print_form_action]]
* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.EditorPrintFormAction` – an action associated with an entity editor screen. The action only selects reports having an external parameter of the *Entity* or the *List of entities* type and where the parameter entity type matches the edited entity type. If only one report is available as a result of selection, it is invoked immediately. If several reports are available, their list is offered to user for selection.
+
The external parameter value – edited entity instance – is passed into the report. If the parameter has the *List of entities* type, then a list containing a single item is passed.
+
Below is an example of using the action in a button located near the standard *OK* and *Cancel* buttons:
+
--
** XML descriptor
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example7.xml[]
----

** Controller
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example8.java[]
----
--

[[execution_history_action]]
* `com.haulmont.reports.gui.actions.list.ExecutionHistoryAction` – a {main_man_url}/standard_actions.html[standard action] for displaying the report <<execution_history,execution history>>. It should be defined for a `Button` or a list component (`Table`, `DataGrid`, etc.).
+
To view the report execution history set the <<reporting.executionHistory.enabled,reporting.executionHistory.enabled>> application property to `true` in the **Administration > Application Properties** screen.
+
Below is an example of using the declarative action for the `GroupTable`:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example3.xml[]
----
<1> - the `type` attribute defines a specific `executionHistory` action type, provided by the framework.
+
Example of programmatically creating the action together with a button declared in the screen XML descriptor:
+
[source, java]
----
include::{sourcesdir}/run_actions_example4.java[]
----
+
When the action is performed, a modal **Execution history** dialog will open where reports related to the current screen will be displayed. After clicking on the **Execution History** button, the execution history for the selected reports will be displayed. If no reports have been selected, then execution history will be displayed for all reports associated with the screen.
