=== Uploaded Files Content Search

Now we need to provide the possibility of file upload for each book publication and to add uploaded files to the `BookPublication` browse screen.

Let us customize `BookPublication` entity. Firstly we add a new `file` attribute which is a many-to-one ASSOCIATION to `FileDescriptor` entity. `FileDescriptor` is the descriptor of the uploaded file (not to be confused with `java.io.FileDescriptor`) that enables referencing the file from the data model objects. 

.New BookPublication Attribute

Save the changes and append the new attribute to the existing `bookPublication.full` view. Then, add the `File` attribute to the `BookPublication` browse and edit screens. To do this, put the cursor to the line containing the attribute and press Alt+Enter. Select *Add entity attribute to screens* and in the appeared dialog select screens that you want the new attribute to be added.

Generate new DB scripts, update the database and restart the application server. If DB is recreated, full-text search becomes disabled by default. Check the *Value* checkbox again in *JMX Console*, reindex all files, process indexing queue, log out and log in back.

As far as we have added the new attribute, the table of publications on `BookPublication` browser screen now contains one more column: *File*. To fill it in, open any line for editing, upload a text file using the new upload field and click OK. By default, CUBA supports `RTF`, `TXT`, `DOC`, `DOCX`, `XLS`, `XSLX`, `ODT`, `ODS`, and `PDF` file formats.

New files appeared in the table. The appearance of the new column can be adjusted.

.BookPublication Browser

Open the *JMX Console* screen, open the `app-core.fts:type=FtsManager` JMX bean and invoke sequentially `reindexAll()` and `processQueue()` to re-index the existing instances in the database and files according to the new search configuration. All new and changed data will be indexed automatically with a delay depending on the scheduled task interval, i.e. not longer than 30 seconds.

As a result, *Full-text search* will now output all the entries including external files contents.
