# CUBA Platform Documentation

## Overview

The documentation is written in AsciiDoc format. Source files, images and includes are located in the `content` directory in the following subdirectories:

-   `manual` - Developer's Manual
-   `polymer` - Polymer UI Tutorial
-   `release_notes` - latest release notes
-   other subdirectories contain documentation on platform addons.

Most of the documents have English and Russian versions in the corresponding subdirectories (`en` and `ru`).

Released documentation is available at [CUBA website](https://www.cuba-platform.com/documentation).

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

In order to produce HTML from AsciiDoc, we use [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org). It can be installed as follows:

1.  Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) (tested on version 2.1).

2.  Install Asciidoctor:

        gem install asciidoctor -v 1.5.2

3.  Install coderay for code highlighting:

        gem install coderay

This is enough to build the documentation with the existing visual theme. If you want to change the theme, see the **Building Theme** section below.

### Build Tasks

Gradle is used as a build tool. Build task names have the following structure: `{purpose}{doc}{lang}`.

**{purpose}** can be one of the following:

-   `build` - build single-HTML document.
-   `chop` - build multi-page document.
-   `war` - build a WAR file. The resulting WAR file will have a name corresponding to the document name and a version which is set by the `ext.docVersion` property defined in `build.gradle`, for example `manual-7.0.war`.
-   `deploy` - deploy WAR to Tomcat (installed by the `setupTomcat` task, see below).

**{doc}** is the document name (`Manual`, `Bpm`, etc.)

**{lang}** can be either `En` or `Ru`.

For example, to build and deploy the English manual, use the following command:

    ./gradlew deployManualEn

Before running the deploy task, install the local Tomcat server by executing the following task:

    ./gradlew setupTomcat

By default, Tomcat is installed into `./deploy/tomcat` and configured to listen on port `6080`.

### Building Theme

The CSS file containing the theme is located in the `styles` directory. Don't change this file - it must be built by the AsciiDoc theme builder. The theme builder is located in the `tools/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory` directory (it is a copy of the [asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory) project).

The theme source code is contained in two files: `sass/cuba.scss` and `sass/settings/_cuba.scss`. After making changes in these files, execute the `buildCubaTheme` Gradle task. As a result, a new `cuba.css` will be written to the `styles` directory.

The `buildCubaTheme` task requires the following Ruby gems:

    gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri sass -v 3.4.22
    gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri compass
    gem install zurb-foundation

If you get an error like

    C:/Program Files/Ruby21-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/compass-core-1.0.3/lib/compass/core/sass_extensions/functions/urls.rb:5:in `has?': undefined method `has?' for Sass::Util:Module (NoMethodError)
            from C:/Program Files/Ruby21-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/compass-core-1.0.3/lib/compass/core/sass_extensions/functions/urls.rb:9:in `included'
            from C:/Program Files/Ruby21-x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.1.0/gems/sass-3.5.0.pre.rc.1/lib/sass/script/functions.rb:632:in `include'

then try to uninstall gem `sass-3.5.0.pre.rc.1` and install `3.4.22`. Perhaps you should also reinstall all the other gems.

## Viewing Documentation Locally

After installing Tomcat and deploying a document as described above, start the server:

    ./deploy/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

If you build, for example, manual for version 7.1, it will be available at
[http://localhost:6080/manual-7.1](http://localhost:6080/manual-7.1).
